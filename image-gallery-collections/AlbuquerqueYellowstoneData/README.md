* `Screenshot_20221109-*.png` (logs showing big name followers of my activity after making [this post](https://github.com/maxieds/ChameleonMiniLiveDebugger/issues/26#issuecomment-1267903486) while staying at a motel in Albuquerque until I left traveling to 'Boulder CO/CA' and ended up stranded in Yellowstone National Park after traveling over an approximately 130mi/diameter crash-landed space craft that dropped me off with friendly antennae in 'Rawlins WY' -- see [safarihospitality.com](safarihospitality.com) and the owner `nick@safarihospitality.com` for actual registered locations).
