I'm eventually writing a book about all of this. The important thing about the datasets I have collected is that 
they are to become public domain (redacting sensitive information like DOB and SSN). This policy will prevent 
the experiences from being classified into obscurity or deleted from the record entirely. It's a good convention 
to start expecting from here on out. 

The CNN trailer for a special about *De Santis vs. Disney* was running while Trump was being arraigned in NYC with 
his famous bodyguard and red haired lawyer (is this what Marjorie Taylor Greene really looks like?) frozen 
on screen. The daily all sacred TED Talks were available as an alternate viewing option on the 
television box I was watching. Those in the know (especially those who actively organize the technology) understand 
well what they mean in San Francisco. Others may have neglected (or not known) to pay attention to AR/VR type 
trafficking mayhem that goes on all over the place. The topic of Disney should be very interesting and timely considering the 
Disney+ licenses (like a EULA accepted by it having been displayed somewhere someone else besides the unwitting consumers 
would have known to look -- possible revision stamped like '*library*' form views of reuse of others' intellectual property) 
on the back of safari prepaid cell service cards. 

A message about the recent VR topics getting so much news recently: 
*Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal risks such as pandemics and nuclear war*. 

I think this is all sadly related. The question is what precisely is it that they (far right extremists) mean by the coining of the term 
VR (most likely some code like the usage of someone versus somebody)?

## Key branches

* [`chimerax-datamine-apkzips` branch](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/tree/chimerax-datamine-apkzips): *Hello, again, [Miss Cheney](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/tree/main/image-gallery-collections/abq-sandia-lizcheney-sms-session-musk-twitter-buyout)!* The book *Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations* by Micah Lee was recently mentioned on the [2600 Off the Hook](https://www.2600.com/offthehook/) podcast. This book gives a more beginner centric introduction to mining these datasets (APKs that can be unzipped to extract hidden metadata, like [this interesting app heirarchy](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/blob/chimerax-datamine-apkzips/androidgo/privapp-apk-res-partial-metadata-coarsely-org/xml/romanesco_backup_contacts_blacklist_account_types.txt2) - Blue/Black Tooth(Berry)/Trees, anyone? - or [this directory](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/tree/chimerax-datamine-apkzips/androidgo/privapp-apk-res-partial-metadata-coarsely-org)). There are free PDF copies available on [the website](https://hacksandleaks.com/). 
* [`androidgo-system-dirs-full` branch](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/tree/androidgo-system-dirs-full): *SHOULD* be deprecated, and superceded by `main`
