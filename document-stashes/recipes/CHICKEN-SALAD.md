# Maxie's chicken salad (winner)

This is inexact. Serve on crossaints or eat a big scoop cold:
* A lot of chicken breast diced (or theigh shredded) after being boiled
* Mayonaise to taste (I like more)
* Dried cranberry
* A big block of coarsely shredded swiss cheese (more is better)
* Dijon mustard (whole grain if you like that on the bun) (optional)
