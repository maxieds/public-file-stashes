      <title>With Rupert Murdoch Out, Is a Fox Sale Possible?</title>
      <description>On a special episode, host Brian Stelter talks to Vanity Fair’s Gabriel Sherman about Rupert Murdoch stepping down as chairman of News Corp and Fox, the 92-year-old media mogul’s legacy, and the future of his sprawling empire. Theories are flying as to why Murdoch officially passed the reins now to his oldest son, Lachlan, including that it might help the family patriarch avoid testifying in another 2020 election case.

      <title>The Exquisite Agony of Being Kevin McCarthy</title>
      <description>Host Brian Stelter talks to Vanity Fair’s Abigail Tracy and veteran political journalist John Harwood about Kevin McCarthy’s failure to control his House GOP caucus as a government shutdown looms. Bombthrowers like Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Lauren Boebert are “not serious people,” says Harwood, a Polis Distinguished Fellow at Duke University. “They're on television, they have podcasts or whatever,” he adds, “but they're not built to do what politicians have to do to make government work.”

      <title>Mitch McConnell's Health Scare and the Future of the GOP</title>
      <description>Host Brian Stelter talked to Politico columnist Jonathan Martin about Mitch McConnell refusing to step down despite a couple on-camera, freeze-ups–and how Republican senators (for now, at least) are standing by him. They discuss the 81-year-old Minority Leader’s relationship with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the senate stalwart's response to Trumpism, and how he factors into America’s political gerontocracy.

      <title>If Biden Falters, Dems Have Prepped the Bench</title>
      <description>Host Brian Stelter takes the pulse of the Democratic Party with Vanity Fair contributing editors Chris Smith and Jennifer Palmieri. They discuss the party's strong bench and possible scenarios if the president and presumptive 2024 nominee, Joe Biden, were to exit the race before election day—from a governor like JB Pritzker or Gretchen Whitmer getting in the ring to Vice President Kamala Harris moving to the top of the ticket.

      <title>How Donald Trump Got the Upper Hand on Fox News</title>
      <description>Host Brian Stelter explores Donald Trump’s tangled relationship with Fox News with Sarah Ellison, national enterprise reporter at The Washington Post, and Oliver Darcy, senior media reporter at CNN. Trump’s decision this week to skip the first Republican debate on Fox News only escalates his war with the Murdochs, even as the cable channel’s hosts remain largely in the former president's corner. And given Trump’s commanding lead in the 2024 primary, it’s looking like Fox needs Trump more than he needs them.

      <description>Host Brian Stelter breaks down the Georgia racketeering charges against Donald Trump with Anthony Michael Kreis, a professor at Georgia State College of Law, and Anna Bower, a Georgia native covering legal affairs in Fulton County for Lawfare. They discuss how the case brought by District Attorney Fani Willis differs from Trump's three previous indictments, the likelihood of any of the ex-president's 18 co-defendents flipping, the potential for cameras in the courtroom, and if this trial can even get underway before the 2024 election.

      <title>How Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump’s Toxic, Twisted Bromance Nearly Drove the Country Off a Cliff </title>
      <description>Host Brian Stelter talks to Rudy Giuliani biographer Andrew Kirtzman and Vanity Fair executive editor Claire Howorth about the epic fall of “America’s Mayor” and his decades-long, symbiotic relationship with Donald Trump. “There's something about Rudy that makes Donald Trump swoon,” says Kirtzman, a veteran political reporter who recalled Giuliani as a “calm, fatherly general” in responding to the Sept. 11 attacks, only to spiral after his failed 2008 presidential bid and sink even lower in the aftermath of the 2020 election. They explore what's next for Giuliani, who may face charges in Georgia and Washington D.C., where he appeared to be co-conspirator #1 in the DOJ's latest indictment of Trump.

      <title>“Unusually Strong”: A Mueller Prosecutor Says Trump's Indictment #3 Packs a Wallop</title>
      <description>Host Brian Stelter breaks down the latest indictment against Donald Trump with Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor, NYU professor, and co-host of MSNBC’s “Prosecuting Donald Trump” podcast. The “variety of sources of evidence” in the DOJ’s election case against Trump is “rock-solid,” says Weissmann, and the forthcoming trial, he adds, should not be viewed through a political lens, but about “whether we are going to adhere to the rule of law.”

      <title>The Jan. 6 Case Against Trump Is "A Shark Beneath the Water"</title>
      <description>CBS News's Robert Costa joins Brian Stelter to dig into the existing indictments against the former President — and take a close look at the swirling waters ahead.

Costa, who co-authored "Peril" with Bob Woodward, says "witnesses, lawyers to witnesses, people familiar with the investigation" into election interference have said the probe is "moving like a shark beneath the water."

This week on Inside the Hive, Delia Cai and Hive staff writer Charlotte Klein discuss the prescient Licht profile and what it reveals about media’s larger state of crisis—one where Tucker Carlson has turned to Twitter, once promising players like BuzzFeed News and VICE have failed, and everything just kind of feels like the depressing Succession finale.

      <title>(Rerun) Lis Smith Says the Path to Trounce Ron DeSantis Is Straight Through Right-Wing Media</title>
      <description>This week, Inside the Hive cohost Joe Hagan talks to Lis Smith, Democratic campaign veteran and author of the new memoir Any Given Tuesday: A Political Love Story, which details her journey, the public one and the private one, through Democratic campaigns over the past 17 years, for candidates as varied as Jon Corzine, Barack Obama, Pete Buttigieg, and, most infamously, former governor Andrew Cuomo, whose lurid political demise she details down to the last moments of his time in office. A savvy political operator, Smith trains her sights on stubborn problems like Florida governor Ron DeSantis, and what to do about President Joe Biden, who, despite his abysmal poll numbers, she says is preparing to come out swinging in advance of the midterms. 
 
“If the [midterms] are a referendum on Democrats, we will be screwed in November,” says Smith, but if Biden and his surrogates can effectively target Trump-tainted election deniers and antiabortion Republicans, “that’s a terrain we can win on. And that’s a switch that we need to flip—we need to flip that switch pretty soon. And we have the opportunity to now.”
 
Smith, who helped take Buttigieg’s star to the national level, is now working with Michigan state senator Mallory McMorrow, who went viral with a searing counterattack on anti-LGBTQ+ Republicans. Smith puts McMorrow on a short list of candidates, along with Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas, to form the future of the party.

      <itunes:summary>This week, Inside the Hive cohost Joe Hagan talks to Lis Smith, Democratic campaign veteran and author of the new memoir Any Given Tuesday: A Political Love Story, which details her journey, the public one and the private one, through Democratic campaigns over the past 17 years, for candidates as varied as Jon Corzine, Barack Obama, Pete Buttigieg, and, most infamously, former governor Andrew Cuomo, whose lurid political demise she details down to the last moments of his time in office. A savvy political operator, Smith trains her sights on stubborn problems like Florida governor Ron DeSantis, and what to do about President Joe Biden, who, despite his abysmal poll numbers, she says is preparing to come out swinging in advance of the midterms. 
 
“If the [midterms] are a referendum on Democrats, we will be screwed in November,” says Smith, but if Biden and his surrogates can effectively target Trump-tainted election deniers and antiabortion Republicans, “that’s a terrain we can win on. And that’s a switch that we need to flip—we need to flip that switch pretty soon. And we have the opportunity to now.”

      <title>How California Plans to Navigate a Future of Apocalyptic Weather</title>
      <description>After weeks of torrential rain storms that have flooded communities, toppled trees and brought on huge economic devastations, Yana Garcia joins Inside the Hive to share how environmental justice will play a role in recovery.

For weeks, a battery of atmospheric rains has bombarded California, destroying roads, triggering mudslides, and flooding homes and farms — all that following months of drought, and before that, wildfires. This week, Inside the Hive is joined by Yana Garcia, California’s Secretary of Environmental Protection, who describes the damages wrought by these extreme storms, and explains what California is doing about it — including facing off with oil companies over the fossil fuel emissions the state argues have intensified weather events in California and beyond. Garcia was an environmental justice lawyer before becoming head of the state’s environmental protection agency, and a native Californian, describes the weather changes she’s observed first hand growing up in Oakland, and the way forward in the fight to correct the climatological balance (plus, she tells us what her mysterious tattoos mean).

      <description>Joe Hagan and Molly Jong-Fast analyze the war inside the Republican Party as California congressman Kevin McCarthy is thrice denied his bid for Speaker of the House. In disarray and denial, the GOP appears intent on kicking off the New Year with the same old extremist politics that have depressed its fortunes through the past three election cycles. 
 
Then, Jong-Fast discusses her exclusive interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, who has the Sisyphean task of tackling immigration—an issue the GOP will surely exploit between now and 2024.

      <description>Author James Pogue talks to cohosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan about the so-called New Right, the intellectual movement congealing around tech billionaire and MAGA mega-donor Peter Thiel and the Trumpist GOP, which he wrote about for this month’s Vanity Fair. After embedding himself with the vanguard of intellectuals whose reactionary politics, antagonism for democracy and visions of retro-patriarchy inform the agendas of people like Tucker Carlson and JD Vance, Pogue demystifies fringe ideas like the “black pill,” “trad wives,” and “ball tanning."

      <title>“People Are Paying With Real Lives”: May Jeong Joins the Hive to Talk China Uprising</title>
      <description>This week, Vanity Fair contributing editor May Jeong joins Inside the Hive to examine the popular uprising against the Xi Jinping regime over its repressive COVID policies, which have held China’s 1.4 billion citizens in virtual captivity. Jeong, who visited China in 2019 to investigate what happened to the country’s biggest movie star, Fan Bingbing, sees parallels to recent uprisings in Iran—specifically, women on the front lines. “The intersectional ways in which our struggles are linked is interesting,” she says, “and something that Americans can draw from as well.”

Plus, Joe Hagan talks to Emily Jane Fox about her latest feature: a look inside the gilded post–White House life of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who want to live a normal, everyday billionaire’s existence in Miami—and have no desire to return to DC should Donald Trump win in 2024.

      <title>“Sit Back and Let Trump Implode”: 2024 Looks Better and Better for DeSantis—But Dems Need a Message</title>
      <description>In the short but long weeks since Elon Musk took over Twitter, it seems like the platform, along with the social media class, has been put through the spin cycle. Between debates over who could be verified and how much that might cost, employee layoffs, and, of course, the lingering question of whether and when Donald Trump might be replatformed, there have been many questions about the fate of Twitter. 
 
Vanity Fair’s Nick Bilton, who literally wrote the book on Twitter, joins this week’s episode of Inside the Hive, taking listeners inside his notebook to lay out the problems that Twitter faces as both a company and a barometer of the mindset of the country. 
 
“Jack Dorsey and all the folks at Twitter used to say that Twitter is a reflection of society,” Bilton tells ITH listeners. “I think that it is a reflection of the extremes in society, and it brings out the best and, a lot more times, the worst in people because of the way it is designed.” What will happen to the platform given the political atmosphere, and can it help propel someone into the White House—or keep them out?

      <title>T-Minus 5 Days. Molly Jong-Fast Joins the Hive Team to Talk Midterms</title>
      <description>With less than a week to go until the midterms determine our country’s future, Joe Hagan and Emily Jane Fox sit down with The Hive’s newest star, special correspondent Molly Jong-Fast, and VF national political reporter Abby Tracy to break down the final stages of races across the country, including how abortion is playing as an issue. 
Plus, CNBC’s Julia Boorstin stops by for a timely discussion about women in power as her new book, When Women Lead, hits shelves. In conversation with Fox, who recently profiled The Wing cofounder Audrey Gelman, Boorstin runs through some of the common traits she sees in women leaders, such as Lena Waithe, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Whitney Wolfe Herd, who are among the interviews in the book.

      <title>GOP Hopes “Women Have a Short Attention Span”: James Carville Talks Dem Midterm Prospects</title>
      <description>This week, Joe Hagan talks to James Carville, veteran Democratic strategist and cable news stalwart, about the lead-up to the midterms. On the table: abortion rights, how Ron DeSantis handled Hurricane Ian (“Do you know what Florida needs more than anything else in the world right now? I do. Immigrants," says Carville), Herschel Walker (“You cannot tell me that anybody 60 years old would trade brains with Herschel Walker, cuz you wouldn’t”), and who won the debate between Trump-approved candidate JD Vance and opponent Tim Ryan in Ohio (“That was a T.K.O.”).
Given the political environment, he says, Democrats wouldn’t ordinarily stand a chance in 2022. “You have an election with 'wrong track' for the country at 65%, presidential approval at 41%—all that is a guaranteed landslide [for Republicans],” he says. "Why has this electorate been resisting this and resisting it hard? That's the question that we should be asking ourselves."
Also this episode: Hagan talks to Narges Bajoghli, a professor of Middle East Studies at John Hopkins, about her recent story on the women leading uprising in Iran, and the implications for gender equality around the world. Hive senior editor Tara Golshan joins a conversation that asks: Where does the revolution go from here?

      <title>Can Ron DeSantis Incept Trump’s Cult of Personality?</title>
      <description>As the Florida governor shows his bully stripes, Inside the Hive asks what his 2024 chances could be. Plus, ‘Creem’ rides again
 
Inside the Ron DeSantis Plan to Overthrow Trump and Trumpism

This week Vanity Fair published Gabe Sherman’s profile of Florida Governor and would-be Trump slayer Ron DeSantis [https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/09/ron-desantis-the-making-and-remaking-of-a-maga-heir]. On Inside the Hive, Joe Hagan and Emily Jane Fox discuss whether DeSantis’s aggressive push for national prominence—coming as Trump's legal peril mounts and a slew of new Trump books hits stores this fall—signal the last throes of the Ex-POTUS’ political potency. The answer, if DeSantis has anything to do with it, is clearly yes. But as DeSantis' polling takes a hit following his controversial immigration stunt, the next question becomes: Can a charmless bully survive the spotlight? 
 
Plus: A conversation with J.J. Kramer, who has revived his father’s storied rock magazine Creem decades after it stopped publishing. The irreverent 1970s magazine still bills itself as “America’s Only Rock ’n Roll Magazine,” but does rock and roll still matter? And what does it mean in 2022? Kramer, who inherited the magazine when he was four years old, has an idea—and big dreams.

      <title>“We're Going to Put Janeane Garofalo or Eddie Vedder in the White House”: The Legacy and Future of Generation X</title>
      <description>In this special episode of Inside the Hive, three guests—Vanity Fair editor in chief Radhika Jones, writer and podcaster Molly Jong-Fast, and standup comic Patton Oswalt—discuss the cultural and political legacy of Generation X. Asks Hive cohost Joe Hagan: How has the slacker generation, once known for irony and ambivalence, weathered the 21st Century?  

The promise of ironic detachment may not have lasted, but Gen X-ers have become the last skeptics of the digital age. The generations that followed "introduced this 24/7 grind mentality,” says Oswalt, "where the people that wanted to live like little lives on the fringe, doing creative stuff, and making enough money to survive—those people are being pushed out…It's like if you're not grinding all the time, you should be wiped off the map. And that, to me, is really, really scary.”

“We are skeptical of effort for effort's sake,” observes Jones. "So there's a way in which we're motivated by substance, and we're skeptical of anything that is not substantive.” 

Thirty years ago, Generation X celebrated what’s now being called “quiet quitting," but as some recent polling has shown, a large chunk of Americans born between 1965 and 1980 also leaned toward Donald Trump in recent elections—a perplexing data point. “We had this sort of belief that we were entitled to certain things,” surmises Jong-Fast. "And if you feel entitled to something, and mad and convinced that someone else has it, that can lead to Trumpism.”

If nothing else, Gen X have always been superb at spitballing from the sidelines: “We are good critics,” says Jones.

      <title>“We Are Currently Being Harmed” by Trump’s Info Breach: Andrew Weissman Breaks Down the Case Against the ExPOTUS</title>
      <description>Never has there been a time in U.S. history when lawyers were as in the foreground as they have been during the era of Donald Trump. Many of them have ended up under the bus, from Michael Cohen to Paul Manafort to Rudy Giuliani. But the many twists and investigatory turns over the last half decade also made household names of a number of bright legal minds. Andrew Weissman is chief among them. As a lead member of Robert Mueller’s special counsel’s office and a professor, Weissman knows how to meticulously break down the facts when it comes to all the president’s mess. 

On this week’s episode of Inside the Hive, he explains just how significant Trump’s national security breach was, without even knowing what’s in the documents secreted away at Mar-a-Lago. And what’s Attorney General Merrick Garland poised to do? Weissman has an idea.

Plus, Hive media reporter Joe Pompeo on the birth of true-crime mania and his new book, “Blood &amp; Ink.”

      <title>“This Is Why We Have Laws”: Bloomberg’s Tim O’Brien on the Case Against Trump</title>
      <description>This week, cohosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan talk to Tim O’Brien, executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion and author of "TrumpNation," about the latest obstacle in the Department of Justice’s investigation into Trump’s handling of top secret documents. The decision by Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, to appoint a “special master” to review the documents and slow the investigation, reeks of politics, says O’Brien. “Does this send a signal to other Trump appointees that you should carry the bag for your handler?” he asks. 

Despite Judge Cannon’s recent ruling, "the reality is this is a very robust and existentially threatening investigation to Donald Trump,” O'Brien adds, and Trump’s political power in the coming midterms is clearly on the wane. Can the law prevail over politics? 

Also in this episode: Hagan talks to Edward Buckles, Jr., director of the searing HBO documentary, “Katrina Babies.” A filmmaker from New Orleans who was 13 at the time of Hurricane Katrina, Buckles explores the tragic fallout on the lives of his friends and loved ones, most of whom never returned to their homes, part of an African-American diaspora largely ignored after the tragedy faded from the American consciousness.

Can the law prevail over politics? </p><p><br></p><p>Also in this episode: Hagan talks to Edward Buckles, Jr., director of the searing HBO documentary, “Katrina Babies.” A filmmaker from New Orleans who was 13 at the time of Hurricane Katrina, Buckles explores the tragic fallout on the lives of his friends and loved ones, most of whom never returned to their homes, part of an African-American diaspora largely ignored after the tragedy faded from the American consciousness.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>“No More Bullshit”: Insurgent Congressman Pat Ryan Says Dems Win by Getting “Real”</title>
      <description>Virtually every poll this summer had Democrat Pat Ryan losing his campaign for Congress to Republican challenger Marc Molinaro, including one released on the day of the election. This week, Ryan joins Inside the Hive’s Joe Hagan to talk about his shock victory in a rural New York district that’s now being viewed as a bellwether for Democratic hopes this fall. Ryan’s campaign (to replace Antonio Delgado, who left his seat to become New York’s lieutenant governor) began at about the same time as the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft Dobbs opinion in May. Ryan, a former Army officer and West Point graduate, leaned into the abortion issue and discovered a highly energized Democratic base. His campaign, he says, focused on “freedom and choice and the idea that I don’t want the government telling me or my fellow Americans what to do in their personal lives. That is clearly a resonant thing, and really a patriotic thing, and so I think that's one of the big takeaways here.”

Along with the Dobbs decision, Ryan says, the January 6 hearings and the Mar-a-Lago raid have underlined the fragility of democracy in the face of GOP overreach, which has become a top issue among voters. “What we’re seeing happen nationally is a wake-up call that these are sort of deeper, more foundational rights,” Ryan says. “We’re not as divided as people might want to make us out to be.” 

“No one expects to agree on everything, that’s crazy,” Ryan observes. Voters “just want you to not bullshit them—no more bullshit. Be real, be a human being, be outraged that freedoms are literally being ripped away from people. And when you do that, it connects. That should not be surprising, but somehow in today’s politics the bar is so low that it somehow does connect and stand out.”

Also this week: Cohost Emily Jane Fox talks to Hive correspondent Joe Pompeo about his juicy exclusive interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, amid her new role and the broader shifting landscape of cable news.

      <title>(Re-run) “The Only Winning Move Is Not to Play”: Vanity Fair's Tech Correspondent on How to Beat Social Media</title>
      <description>This week, Vanity Fair tech correspondent Nick Bilton speaks with cohost Joe Hagan about the recent leaks from Facebook that reveal the company knew of the toxic impact of their platforms, including Instagram, on users, especially teenage girls. In a world in which the social media giants—FAANG, or Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google—are too rich and powerful to be contained by limp political and regulatory systems, “we’re left to the wolves,” says Bilton. After covering the social media world for a decade, Bilton says the only way to beat the media giants is to hack the system—ourselves—by reprogramming our behaviors, which are the literal coins of the social media realm.

      <title>Lis Smith Says the Path to Trounce Ron DeSantis Is Straight Through Right-Wing Media</title>
      <description>This week, Inside the Hive cohost Joe Hagan talks to Lis Smith, Democratic campaign veteran and author of the new memoir Any Given Tuesday: A Political Love Story, which details her journey, the public one and the private one, through Democratic campaigns over the past 17 years, for candidates as varied as Jon Corzine, Barack Obama, Pete Buttigieg, and, most infamously, former governor Andrew Cuomo, whose lurid political demise she details down to the last moments of his time in office. A savvy political operator, Smith trains her sights on stubborn problems like Florida governor Ron DeSantis, and what to do about President Joe Biden, who, despite his abysmal poll numbers, she says is preparing to come out swinging in advance of the midterms. 
 
“If the [midterms] are a referendum on Democrats, we will be screwed in November,” says Smith, but if Biden and his surrogates can effectively target Trump-tainted election deniers and antiabortion Republicans, “that’s a terrain we can win on. And that’s a switch that we need to flip—we need to flip that switch pretty soon. And we have the opportunity to now.”
 
Smith, who helped take Buttigieg’s star to the national level, is now working with Michigan state senator Mallory McMorrow, who went viral with a searing counterattack on anti-LGBTQ+ Republicans. Smith puts McMorrow on a short list of candidates, along with Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas, to form the future of the party.


Listen to Joe's record: "Earl’s Closet: The Lost Archive of Earl McGrath, 1970-1980."

“If the [midterms] are a referendum on Democrats, we will be screwed in November,” says Smith, but if Biden and his surrogates can effectively target Trump-tainted election deniers and antiabortion Republicans, “that’s a terrain we can win on. And that’s a switch that we need to flip—we need to flip that switch pretty soon. And we have the opportunity to now.”
 
Smith, who helped take Buttigieg’s star to the national level, is now working with Michigan state senator Mallory McMorrow, who went viral with a searing counterattack on anti-LGBTQ+ Republicans. Smith puts McMorrow on a short list of candidates, along with Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas, to form the future of the party.


Listen to Joe's record: "Earl’s Closet: The Lost Archive of Earl McGrath, 1970-1980."

      <description>This week, Vanity Fair contributing editor Jeff Sharlet joins Inside the Hive to talk about his journey into the far-right world of Jan. 6 insurrectionists, Qanon-ers and Trump cultists — who they are, what they’re saying, what they believe, and what their still-growing movement might portend (including the specter of civil war in America). 

Also: Willem Marx, a London-based contributor to Vanity Fair, discusses the fall of British PM Boris Johnson as well as his latest report on the undue influence of Putin-connected Russian oligarchs in the British establishment - including, allegedly, Johnson himself.

      <title>“If You Bite the Head Off of the Snake, the Rest of the Snake Will Die”: Daniel Goldman on Prosecuting Trump</title>
      <description>This week Inside the Hive features two guests focused on the Jan. 6 hearings. First, Daniel Goldman, former federal prosecutor and newly-announced candidate for New York's 10th congressional district, analyzes the findings of the Select Committee investigating the insurrection from the point of view of a lead lawyer in the first Trump impeachment. “If [Merrick Garland] doesn't charge him because Trump is a former president, then that is political,” Goldman says. “And so if you want to de-politicize the Department of Justice, you can't not charge him.”

Second, Inside the Hive talks to Alex Holder, the British filmmaker whose exclusive access to Donald Trump and his family before, during and after Jan. 6 has turned his forthcoming documentary, Unprecedented, into explosive new evidence for the Committee and the filmmaker himself into a possible witness. After witnessing Trump’s “tone of belligerence," says Holder, “I predicted that [the Jan. 6 insurrection] was going to happen the night before.”

      <title>“Thoughts and Prayers, Thoughts and Prayers”: How Two Comics Pranked the NRA</title>
      <description>This week, Inside the Hive co-host Joe Hagan talks to Jason Selvig and Davram Steifler, the comedy duo known as The Good Liars, about their viral prank on the National Rifle Association in late May. Selvig, posing as an NRA ally, stood before Wayne LaPierre and thanked him for his continual “thoughts and prayers” for mass shootings, presenting a brutally exhaustive list. The duo has attended 15 Trump rallies, poking at the QAnon insanity inside, and were eyewitnesses to the insurrection on Jan. 6th—which they also managed to turn into pointed comedy. “You couldn't help but feel like they were getting ready for a battle reenactment or something,” says Steifler. "Everyone we stopped was like, ‘This is 1776.’”

      <title>“He’s a One-Man Crime Wave”: Rep. Jamie Raskin on Donald Trump and the Jan. 6 Hearings</title>
      <description>Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a key member of the Jan. 6 Committee investigating the Capitol attack, gives Inside the Hive an exclusive preview of next week’s primetime hearings. 

After nearly a year of investigating the insurrection, Raskin says the most surprising discovery has been "the role that money played, and the role of a financial motive behind all these events, to keep the money pouring in.” The committee, he promises, will also draw direct and indirect lines between “the top of the Republican hierarchy” and the "violent hooligans and street fascists” who overran the Capitol. 

But will Donald J. Trump himself be implicated? Raskin has said the former president will get his “comeuppance" but whether he’ll face direct criminal justice for his “premeditated” role in an attempted coup remains an open question. Tantalizingly, Raskin deflects on the question of whether former VP Mike Pence has spoken to the committee or might testify against Trump. "I can't get into it,” he says. 

Plus: Raskin offers a powerful message and emotional plea to Democrats demoralized by the political landscape facing the party going into the midterms.

      <itunes:subtitle>Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a key member of the Jan. 6 Committee investigating the Capitol attack, gives Inside the Hive an exclusive preview of next week’s primetime hearings.    After nearly a year of investigating the insurrection, Raskin says the most surprising discovery has been "the role that money played, and the role of a financial motive behind all these events, to keep the money pouring in.” The committee, he promises, will also draw direct and indirect lines between “the top of the Republican hierarchy” and the "violent hooligans and street fascists” who overran the Capitol.   But will Donald J. Trump himself be implicated? Raskin has said the former president will get his “comeuppance" but whether he’ll face direct criminal justice for his “premeditated” role in an attempted coup remains an open question. Tantalizingly, Raskin deflects on the question of whether former VP Mike Pence has spoken to the committee or might testify against Trump. "I can't get into it,” he says.   Plus: Raskin offers a powerful message and emotional plea to Democrats demoralized by the political landscape facing the party going into the midterms. </itunes:subtitle>

      <title>We Don't Deserve Beto O'Rourke</title>
      <description>The only public figure with the guts to confront cynical Republicans over gun laws and the Texas massacre was a defiant Democrat who the media class long ago dismissed: gubernatorial nominee Beto O’Rourke. Inside the Hive cohosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan grapple with the horrors of this week's events in Uvalde and what they say about our broken politics and national backslide. When rare instances of idealism and courage are framed by political elites as mere opportunism, is there any hope left? Where do we go from here?

      <title>“This Is The Terrifying Future”: Feminist Writer Rebecca Traister On The Death Of Roe v Wade</title>
      <description>Rebecca Traister, feminist, author and New York Magazine contributor, talks to co-host Joe Hagan about the shocking Supreme Court leak that all but confirms the impending death of Roe v. Wade. Democratic leadership from President Joe Biden to Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi have failed, Traister says, to formulate a "robust and morally persuasive message” to counteract the decades-long march of anti-choice Republicans who are set on reengineering society to the past. With consequential elections on the horizon, the fall of Roe could very well mean the toppling of other progressive rulings, from the right to contraception to marriage equality and even interracial unions. Traister finds slivers of hope in a new generation of progressive female voices who are forcefully connecting abortion rights to economics, class, and race as they face "an era that none of us can imagine.”

After embedding himself with the vanguard of intellectuals whose reactionary politics, antagonism for democracy and visions of retro-patriarchy inform the agendas of people like Tucker Carlson and JD Vance, Pogue demystifies fringe ideas like the “black pill,” “trad wives,” and “ball tanning."

      <title>“There’s evil out there”: Rep. Charlie Crist on Florida, DeSantis and Disney</title>
      <description>This week, Inside the Hive cohost Joe Hagan talks to Florida Congressman Charlie Crist, former Republican and one-time governor, about the culture wars emanating from his home state and specifically, from Governor Ron DeSantis. As DeSantis passes discriminatory new laws targeting gay and trans people, generating partisan bile for a potential presidential run, Crist is betting DeSantis is a “paper tiger” who is weaker than he appears. "I think he's terribly vulnerable,” he says. “[His] support is a mile wide and an inch deep.”

Taking a page from Biden’s playbook against Trump in 2020, Crist thinks voters secretly want civility and not bullying, Disney and not DeSantis, even if current polling shows DeSantis trouncing Crist in a theoretical match up. "I'm an optimist, I'm idealistic, and I believe good will triumph over bad,” Crist says.

      <itunes:title>“There’s evil out there”: Rep. Charlie Crist on Florida, DeSantis and Disney</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:author>Vanity Fair</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>This week, Inside the Hive cohost Joe Hagan talks to Florida Congressman Charlie Crist, former Republican and one-time governor, about the culture wars emanating from his home state and specifically, from Governor Ron DeSantis. As DeSantis passes discriminatory new laws targeting gay and trans people, generating partisan bile for a potential presidential run, Crist is betting DeSantis is a “paper tiger” who is weaker than he appears. "I think he's terribly vulnerable,” he says. “[His] support is a mile wide and an inch deep.”   Taking a page from Biden’s playbook against Trump in 2020, Crist thinks voters secretly want civility and not bullying, Disney and not DeSantis, even if current polling shows DeSantis trouncing Crist in a theoretical match up. "I'm an optimist, I'm idealistic, and I believe good will triumph over bad,” Crist says.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>“Seven Hours and Thirty Seven Minutes”: Robert Costa of CBS News on Trump’s Jan. 6 “Gap” </title>
      <description>This week, cohost Joe Hagan digs into the latest on the Jan. 6 story with CBS New correspondent Robert Costa, who, along with legendary reporter Bob Woodward, broke the news that the House Committee investigating the insurrection discovered a 7 hour and 37 minute gap in Donald Trump’s call logs from that day. Costa explains the importance of that Watergate-like hole in Trump's story — when he was MIA while the Capitol burned — and what it may portend for the investigation. He also defends the Department of Justice against critics who believe AG Merrick Garland isn’t doing enough to probe Trump’s involvement in an attempted coup. “Maybe we just don't know the full story because they work like sharks,” he says. "They're underwater in a way congressional committees are not.”

      <title>The Tangled, Messy Roots of Fake News</title>
      <description>People were grappling with "fake news" long before it became Donald Trump's favorite term.

Fake news might feel new — but the concept has a long twisted history in the United States, as Andie Tucher, a Columbia Journalism School professor and author of the new book "Not Exactly Lying: Fake News and Fake Journalism in American History," tells Inside the Hive cohost Emily Jane Fox this week. How did we get to this moment, with its toxic mix of hyperpartisanship, disinformation, and seemingly endless turmoil? What is the role of social media, and of Donald Trump and Fox News in making our understanding of reality feel so dire? Tucher also explains how Democrats and Republicans, as well as liberal media and conservative media, communicate about truth differently, and explores how we can restore faith in our sources of news.

      <title>Kyiv "Looks Like A Fortress": CNN's Matthew Chance On Covering Russia's Brutal War</title>
      <description>CNN senior international correspondent Matthew Chance flew to Kyiv in January as Russia began amassing troops on Ukraine's borders, and was in the capital on February 24 when it launched its brutal assault. He tells Inside the Hive cohost Joe Hagan about covering a war that has transformed a country overnight, sending millions fleeing and others into the resistance as Russia targets civilians in its quest to take over the country. Chance describes what he witnessed, and what it’s like to be a journalist on the ground, as fellow reporters lose their lives. He also mulls what the war could mean for the global order, and the hopeless quagmire Vladimir Putin now finds himself in. Now recouping in London, Chase says the Kyiv he last saw was the tragic shell of a formerly vibrant metropolis, a hollowed-out death trap awaiting Russian forces with "a javelin anti-tank missile in every window.”

      <title>“The Money Was Too Good”: Who Are the Oligarchs and What Do They Want?</title>
      <description>This week, Inside the Hive cohosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan talk to an expert on the ultrarich oligarchs behind Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Dartmouth sociologist and author Brooke Harrington. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has implicated Putin’s feudal system of corrupt oligarchs, rallying the West to trying to seize their offshore bank accounts and superyachts. Taking their stuff could weaken them, but Harrington says tarnishing and destroying their social status in London and New York, where they’ve built opulent fiefdoms, may be just as effective. Also, Harrington tells of her efforts to join the White House’s new anti-oligarch task force, KleptoCapture—with distressing results.

      <title>“He's A Small Man Of 5’6" Saying he's 5’7”: The Psychology Behind Putin’s War</title>
      <description>Russia expert Nina Khrushcheva and Trump impeachment hero Alexander Vindman explain what is driving Putin's assault on Ukraine — and how Republicans also have blood on their hands.
Cohosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan interview two leading experts about Russia's invasion of Ukraine — how it happened and how it could reshape the world as we know it. First, Nina Krushcheva, a Russia expert and professor at the New School in New York, takes us inside the mind of Vladimir Putin, how he was underestimated and whether the cold, calculated ex-KGB man has finally succumbed to a world-historic megalomania. Next, Hagan talks to Alexander Vindman, the former Army Lt. Colonel and outspoken participant in Trump's first impeachment trial that revolved around the then president's attempts to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine. Vindman reserves his harshest criticism for Putin sympathizers in the GOP: “These folks have blood on their hands. They're going to own this.”

Next, Hagan talks to Alexander Vindman, the former Army Lt. Colonel and outspoken participant in Trump's first impeachment trial that revolved around the then president's attempts to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine. Vindman reserves his harshest criticism for Putin sympathizers in the GOP: “These folks have blood on their hands. They're going to own this.”</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>"Becoming Lucy Sante”: What does it mean to transition?</title>
      <description>This week, cohost Joe Hagan talks to renowned writer, culture critic, and scholar Lucy Sante, whose essay in the February issue of Vanity Fair describes her transition at age 67. Sante expands on her many stages of personal revelation—how the “egg” was cracked—and the relief and liberation she experienced in embracing her long-denied gender as well as the challenges she still faces, personally, socially, and romantically. While she works on a new book about her self discovery, the author of nonfiction classics like Low Life and Factory of Facts is navigating the misunderstood nexus of gender and sexuality with her signature erudition, wit and curiosity.

      <description>This week, cohost Joe Hagan talks to Hive media correspondent Joe Pompeo, who helps unwind the Succession-worthy melodrama around the departure of CNN president Jeff Zucker in the wake of the ouster of anchor Chris Cuomo, which itself came in the wake of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s resignation following accusations of sexual harassment. How does one ouster connect to the other? And was the reason Zucker gave for his exit — failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a top CNN executive — the true reason he left or is there something more at work? Pompeo explores the possibilities and reveals new details. All this and the drama surrounding Joe Rogan too on the latest episode of Inside the Hive.

      <title>In a New Memoir, Katie Couric Is “Going There” — But Where Was She Exactly?</title>
      <description>This week, Katie Couric, legendary onetime cohost of NBC’s Today show, talks to Inside the Hive's Joe Hagan about her frank and searing new memoir, Going There, which pulls back the curtain on her starry and sometimes starcrossed life and career. Couric recounts the sexist culture of network TV but also examines her own place in a culture that allowed alleged abusers like Matt Lauer, Jeff Fager and Les Moonves (Couric allies all) to thrive. There’s plenty of blame to go around - including Couric's charge, in her book, that Hagan’s 2007 cover story on Couric in New York magazine was a “hit job.” Hagan and Couric visit the spirits of media Past, Present and Yet to Come.

      <title>Did the Lingerie Business Make Jeffrey Epstein Possible?</title>
      <description>As the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell starts up this week, Inside the Hive cohost Joe Hagan talks to Vanity Fair correspondents Vanessa Grigoriadis and Gabriel Sherman about their reporting on the Jeffrey Epstein scandal—what we know, what we don’t know, and what the whole sordid affair tells us about power and sexism in America. Grigoriadis’s latest podcast series, Fallen Angel: The Victoria’s Secret Story, details the fascinating history of the lingerie chain and the cultural damage it did to a generation of women, including its own models. Sherman, a featured voice, explains how Ohio-based owner Les Wexner came under Epstein’s spell and helped finance his predatory designs on women and girls. The ironies are rich: “This man who was so connected to Jeffrey Epstein is also the man who was making that lingerie that young girls were coveting,” observes Grigioriadis.

      <title>As Texas Goes, So Goes the Nation: Lone Star Candidate Matthew Dowd on How Democrats Can Win in 2022  The veteran political adviser and analyst talks about now running for office himself on Inside the Hive.</title>
      <description>Matthew Dowd, former Bush campaign adviser turned analyst, has spent his career behind the scenes. But now he’s running as a Democrat for lieutenant governor of Texas in 2022—with eyes locked on hard-right incumbent Dan Patrick, the man responsible for pushing through the infamous voter-suppression and antiabortion bills that have galvanized Republicans and alarmed Democrats. On this week’s Inside the Hive, Dowd analyzes the state of the Democratic Party and makes the case that if Texas can be turned blue (finally), the spread of Trumpism can be stopped nationally too. And even if the Biden administration can’t pull out of its current slump, he argues, Democrats can still beat Republicans at the state level. Dowd weighs in on Biden, congressional Democrats, Beto O’Rourke—and his favorite Matthew McConaughey film.

      <title>“The Only Winning Move Is Not to Play”: Vanity Fair's Tech Correspondent on How to Beat Social Media</title>
      <description>This week, Vanity Fair tech correspondent Nick Bilton speaks with cohost Joe Hagan about the recent leaks from Facebook that reveal the company knew of the toxic impact of their platforms, including Instagram, on users, especially teenage girls. In a world in which the social media giants—FAANG, or Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google—are too rich and powerful to be contained by limp political and regulatory systems, “we’re left to the wolves,” says Bilton. After covering the social media world for a decade, Bilton says the only way to beat the media giants is to hack the system—ourselves—by reprogramming our behaviors, which are the literal coins of the social media realm.

      <title>“Texans Are Being Held Hostage”: Julián Castro on “WTF Is Happening” in the Lone Star State</title>
      <description>This week, Julián Castro, onetime Democratic presidential candidate and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Barack Obama, joins Inside the Hive to discuss the hard-right push on guns, abortion, and voting in Texas, which has become a blueprint for recalcitrant Trumpist states, and what Democrats are going to do about it. Castro is worried about what he calls Biden’s relatively weak leadership—especially his handling of the border crisis. “My hope is that the Biden administration is going to reverse course on this very soon,” he says. He also sketches out a scenario in which his former competitor, Beto O’Rourke, runs for governor of Texas in 2022 and helps Democrats retake power after years of dashed hopes: “I believe that he has a shot to beat Greg Abbott.”

      <title>"I thought you said you’d never forget”: A conversation on 9/11 with author Elliot Ackerman</title>
      <description>This week, co-host Joe Hagan talks to novelist Elliot Ackerman, a veteran of both the Afghan and Iraq wars, on the meaning of 9/11 and the long-term impact on American life, politics and culture. A critic of the Biden administration’s exit from Afghanistan, Ackerman has struggled with feelings of bitterness over the wars that defined his life and redefined the nation. As media and politics have become more extreme and polarized in the 20 years since 9/11, the country has become more cynical and demoralized, less able to unify in a crisis. An optimist in a pessimistic time, Ackerman looks for signs of hope in America's founding ideals--enlightenment, reason--even if the country never quite lives up to them.

      <description>In the wake of the shocking Supreme Court move that has allowed Texas to effectively ban abortion, cohost Joe Hagan conducts back to back interviews with Amy Hagstrom Miller, of Whole Women’s Health, which operates abortion clinics in Texas, and Wendy Davis, a veteran of Texas politics and founder of Deeds Not Words, a nonprofit committed to gender equality. Addressing the law and its ramifications for women (and especially women of color), Miller and Davis bring front line news and historical context to this demoralizing moment in the years-long battle for women’s reproductive rights.

As the Taliban take over the country following the US’s chaotic exit last week, the fate of Mohseni’s media outlet in Kabul, staffed with 450 Afghans, hangs in the balance. Will the Taliban shut down or take over the TV network? Even as Mohseni looks for signs of hope in a young population weened on TV and Internet access (including the Taliban themselves), he remains wary of the Taliban's extremism, misogyny and censorship and expresses anger at the Biden administration’s handling of the pullout, which has left his beloved country to a grim fate after decades of cynical US foreign policy.

      <title>How Florida Turned American Politics into a Tabloid Nightmare</title>
      <description>This week, Vanity Fair correspondent Gabriel Sherman joins cohost Joe Hagan to discuss the “Floridization” of conservative politics, from the hanging chads of the 2000 election to Trump’s “Southern White House” in Palm Beach to Governor Ron DeSantis’s ostensible 2024 campaign slogan, “Make America Florida.” The Hive correspondents explore the history of tabloid and conservative media in Florida and the inevitable merger of the two in the form of Trumpism, expanding and riffing on Hagan’s feature in the September issue of Vanity Fair, “Postcards from the Edge."

      <title>What’s on Mark’s Mind?: Journalist Sheera Frenkel on the “Ugly Truth” about Facebook</title>
      <description>This week, New York Times reporter Sheera Frenkel, coauthor of the blockbuster book “An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook's Battle for Domination,” describes her and coauthor Cecilia Kang's deep dive into the history and ambitions of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. How and why did Zuck allow his tech behemoth to become a hothouse of hate speech, misinformation and coordinated attacks on world governments? And what has he done about it? Frenkel explains to cohost Joe Hagan how Zuckerberg's pursuit of power has run roughshod over social responsibility, as he cashes in on Kumbaya connectivity instead. With Donald Trump suing Facebook for temporarily evicting him and Joe Biden accusing the platform of “killing people” by spreading vaccine misinformation, Zuckerberg keeps his eyes on the 5 billion customers that remain to be converted to the platform. An in-depth conversation.

      <title>“Long-Term Disaster Is the Best-Case Scenario”: Author Nathaniel Rich Sounds the Alarm on Climate Change</title>
      <description>Floods, wildfires, skies filled with smoke and ash—it’s been a summer full of alarming signs of climate change. This week, journalist and novelist Nathaniel Rich joins Joe Hagan on Inside the Hive to discuss the looming catastrophe we’ve known about for decades but have consistently failed to slow, let alone stop. Should we take the climate fight to politicians and corporations, or is our system too hopelessly broken to respond to the earth’s rising temperatures? How much do individual choices like eating vegan or driving electric cars really help? The author of Losing Earth: A Recent History talks about his personal response as he paints a portrait of ignorance and bad faith among the powers that be. Rich also suggests new ways to change and deepen our relationship to our planet in crisis—including the power of fiction.

      <description>This week, veteran Hive correspondent Chris Smith talks to co-host Joe Hagan about the winner of the Democratic primary for New York mayor, Eric Adams, and his journey toward the most powerful office in the city. Smith has been covering city politics for more than two decades, through Bloomberg’s three terms and Bill DeBlasio’s seven tumultuous years, and understands better than most the risks and opportunities for a city trying to reinvent itself after the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests of last summer. Can a former policeman and savvy self-promoter like Adams lower crime, enact police reforms while also earning the trust of the NYPD and shepherd the city to prosperity? Chris Smith explains it all to you.

From Bitcoin to Ethereum, from Elon Musk’s favored Dogecoin to the dreaded “shitcoin," Bilton, who has covered technology for over a decade, links cryptocurrencies to the evolution of an Internet culture driven by speculators, conspiracists and opportunists — and then answers the $33,000 question (the current price of Bitcoin): Should we actually invest in these things?

From Bitcoin to Ethereum, from Elon Musk’s favored Dogecoin to the dreaded “shitcoin," Bilton, who has covered technology for over a decade, links cryptocurrencies to the evolution of an Internet culture driven by speculators, conspiracists and opportunists — and then answers the $33,000 question (the current price of Bitcoin): Should we actually invest in these things?</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>How Jon Chu’s In the Heights Bet on the Big Screen and Won</title>
      <description>A year ago, when the pandemic was first raging, director Jon Chu faced a painful decision: He could send his new musical adaptation of Lin Manuel Miranda’s “In the Heights” straight to streaming on HBO or wait for the theaters to reopen once the pandemic was over—a depressingly indeterminate time. Now it looks like that decision has paid off. Chu and his film editor Myron Kerstein return to Inside the Hive to talk about the experience of keeping their dream alive while the world twisted and turned. The movie — about a community of immigrants friends and families struggling to keep their “suenitos” alive in New York’s Washington Heights — arrives in a poetic new context that not even Hollywood could have dreamed up: “In the Heights,” screening in 5,300 theaters in the U.S., is the first real blockbuster film to test the power of cinemas after a year of closure. Chu and Kerstein discuss the long journey to the screen, the influences and ideas that went into making it, Chu's desire to mint a new cast of unknown Latino stars (like Anthony Ramos), the unlikely story of how the soon-to-be-iconic swimming pool sequence was conceived and created, and their hopes for a financial success that will make similar musicals possible.

      <title>Danny Meyer on the New Future of New York City Restaurants</title>
      <description>A year ago, when restauranteur Danny Meyer first stopped by Inside the Hive, the restaurant industry—and every industry, really—was in peril. He’d just laid off 2,000 employees, closed all of his restaurants, and had no idea how they could pivot or when things would get better. This week, he joins co-host Emily Jane Fox to discuss preparing to operate at 100 percent capacity as a vaccinated New York City roars back to life and how he thinks the business will change forever.

      <title>After George Floyd: An interview with Minneapolis Activist Sheila Nezhad</title>
      <description>This week, Inside the Hive cohost Joe Hagan interviews Sheila Nezhad, the Minneapolis activist whose candidacy for mayor against incumbent Jacob Frey has been powered by the protest movement in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. Nezhad gives an eyewitness account of the scene when former Officer Derek Chavin was convicted of murder and manslaughter this week, a verdict that left the city relieved but with unanswered questions about the future of law enforcement and racial justice. With the Justice Department investigating the practices of the Minneapolis Police Department, Nezhad sees an opening for a different kind of American city, one without a police department but with more social services and a larger safety net. Whether Nezhad's vision is unrealistic or inevitable is both the key to her political future and the knife’s edge of a national reckoning.

      <title>Beautiful and Not So Beautiful Things: Inside the Hive Reviews the Hunter Biden Memoir</title>
      <description>This week, cohosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan pour through the pages of Beautiful Things, the eye-popping new Hunter Biden memoir, to highlight the best revelations and insights—not only into a President’s son, but into the Biden presidency itself and this peculiar (but hopeful) moment in American history. A tearful and candid tale of addiction and familial love, the book describes in excruciating detail the death of Hunter's brother Beau, the Biden family's private struggles in the aftermath, and Hunter’s lurid descent into alcoholism and crack addiction. He also attempts to set the record straight on the Burisma controversy that made him the political whipping boy for Donald Trump. An Inside the Hive book review.
Bonus: Speaking of beautiful things, Emily Jane Fox has a life-altering revelation of her own for podcast listeners.

      <description>On this week's episode of Inside the Hive, co-hosts Joe Hagan and Emily Jane Fox dissect the allegations against Congressman Matt Gaetz—namely that he bankrolled the travel of a 17-year-old with whom he was romantically involved—and his puzzling spin on them. Plus, Infrastructure Week is for real this time, and perhaps Twitter is a construct we could all do without.

      <title>"I've Got to Do Something. I've Got to Say Something”: A Conversation with CNN’s Don Lemon</title>
      <description>The Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 catalyzed Black Americans far and wide, and CNN’s Don Lemon, the only African-American cable news anchor in primetime, was no different. Lemon joins Inside the Hive to discuss his bestselling new book, This Is the Fire: What I Say to My Friends About Racism. In it, Lemon describes how the Trump years exposed America’s racial wounds, but also cleared the way for a new era of accountability. "People are being held accountable and they cannot just say something bigoted or racist or insensitive or inappropriate with impunity anymore,” Lemon observes. 
But he also believes in forgiveness. Addressing free speech and “cancel culture,” Lemon says, "I think you have to allow people grace in the conversation and in the act of trying to do the right thing.” 
Despite the divisions of the last four years, Lemon remains optimistic about the promise of pluralism, if for no other reason than demographics and the logic of capitalism. “We're all gonna have to learn to get together because that's what our country will be,” he says. “I think the way that we're going to do that is not by segregating ourselves, but by having relationships with people who don't look like us, because when you do that you get to experience other people's humanity, it is harder for you to treat them as other."

      <title>“It Was a Test of My Mettle. Am I Really About What I Say I'm About?”: A Conversation with Late Show Band Leader Jon Batiste</title>
      <description>This week, Inside the Hive welcomes special guest Jon Batiste, leader of the Stay Human Band on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Hot off his Golden Globe win for his work on the score of Pixar’s Soul, Batiste's latest album, We Are, represents a vivid turn from straight jazz into a joyful, danceable pop and neo-soul. It's also a bold declaration of conscience: catalyzed by the Black Lives Matter movement of last summer, when he rallied protestors with an ad hoc street band, Batiste wanted to deliver a personal statement on his own experience as a Black man in America. “We have to hold ourselves accountable to the things that we profess to believe,” he says. 

Batiste collaborated with 200 musicians, producers, and friends, including Quincy Jones, Mavis Staples, and even author Zadie Smith, with whom he held regular singing sessions over Zoom at the height of the pandemic. Here he recounts his own musical evolution, from Louisiana, where he grew up in a storied musical family, to New York, where he studied jazz piano at Juilliard and later developed what he’s come to call “social music,” a sound that draws on, in addition to New Orleans jazz, Duke Ellington, Stevie Wonder, Wu Tang Clan and even Bjork to find a common humanity in a time of division.

Hot off his Golden Globe win for his work on the score of Pixar’s Soul, Batiste's latest album, We Are, represents a vivid turn from straight jazz into a joyful, danceable pop and neo-soul. It's also a bold declaration of conscience: catalyzed by the Black Lives Matter movement of last summer, when he rallied protestors with an ad hoc street band, Batiste wanted to deliver a personal statement on his own experience as a Black man in America. “We have to hold ourselves accountable to the things that we profess to believe,” he says. 

Batiste collaborated with 200 musicians, producers, and friends, including Quincy Jones, Mavis Staples, and even author Zadie Smith, with whom he held regular singing sessions over Zoom at the height of the pandemic.

      <title>The “Absolute and Abject Failure” of the GOP: Democratic Stars Joe Neguse and Beto O’Rourke on Trump, Cruz, and Finding Hope</title>
      <description>In this double feature episode of Inside the Hive, cohosts Joe Hagan and Emily Jane Fox interview rising Democratic star Joe Neguse, Congressman from Colorado, about last week’s impeachment trial of Donald Trump and what was and was not achieved after Republicans refused to convict. Neguse takes us behind the scenes with the impeachment managers, including the controversial decision not to call witnesses before a final vote, and considers what lessons Democrats should draw from it. 

That's followed by Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke, who talks to Hagan about the state of emergency in Texas and the intransigence of his former rival for Senate, Ted Cruz. O’Rourke lays into Cruz, who flew to Cancún during statewide blackouts: "I don't know how much we were expecting from him to begin with,” he says. “That guy wants nothing to do with government, or at least our form of it.” Whether voters, suffering from food shortages following a freak snow storm, will make the GOP pay—and create an opening for O’Rourke to run for Texas governor in 2022—remains to be seen. But O’Rourke finds optimism for the country in new leaders like Neguse, who he calls “an all-time American hero.”

      <title>Can Trump’s Grip on the GOP Be Loosened?: Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger Says Yes</title>
      <description>This week, Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, joins Inside the Hive to talk about his campaign to steer the GOP away from Donald Trump, the QAnon conspiracy cult, and the insurrection of January 6. In advance of an impeachment trial in the Senate, Kinzinger has allied himself with Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney and voted to remove Trump ally and QAnon adherent Marjorie Taylor Greene from her congressional committees. But he acknowledges a tough battle ahead, not least the struggle to bring Trump’s base out of the “fog” of disinformation, comparing the current crossroads to the morning after a Friday-night “bender”: “The easy answer is to drink a Bloody Mary and just feel a little better and start up again,” he says. “Or you can take a look at what you did and…bear the pain a little bit.” The congressman recently started a PAC to support “country first” Republicans and predicts that sanity will prevail and Trump’s support will deteriorate within six months. “[Trump] doesn't have Twitter, he's not blinding people,” he observes. “And I think folks are gonna wake up … and say, ‘The party of Trump is not the party that's going to be in the majority of the future.’”

      <title>“I Don’t Tense Up in Atlanta When I See the Police": An Interview with Author Charles Blow</title>
      <description>This week, Inside the Hive co-host Joe Hagan talks to New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow about his provocative new book, The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto, which proposes a reverse migration of young Black people from northern cities to the South to try replicating what Stacy Abrams achieved in Georgia in the 2020 presidential and congressional races. Post-Civil Rights empowerment for Black populations has failed to materialize, argues Blow, with racism as pernicious, if not more so, in the “liberal” north as the south. The only way for Blacks to claim true power, he says, is through self determination—creating large Black population centers in places like Atlanta and turning the political tide in their direction. Blow paints a searing portrait of fair-weather liberals whose BLM protests last summer he likens to "a social justice Coachella” that ultimately failed to deliver policy changes. “Somehow Black people are supposed to pat white people on the back and say, ‘You're getting there, I'll keep waiting?’” he says, calling Dr. King's dream of white and Black children joining hands a naive vision. "I have three children in this world,” Blow says. “The idea that they can still be fighting some form of the thing that I'm fighting today, when I am gone from this earth, is insane to me.”

      <title>“Nothing About What Trump Does Surprises Me": An Interview with Democratic Superlawyer Marc Elias</title>
      <description>This week, Inside the Hive welcomes Marc Elias, the lawyer who defended the election results against the Trump campaign’s assault, winning 62 out of 63 court cases in multiple states. Despite the fraud claims of seven senators and 121 members of congress who rebelled against the certification of Joe Biden's win this week, Elias says “not a single judge found a single vote that was fraudulent. None. Zero.” The bloodshed at the Capitol on Wednesday was more predictable than it was shocking, he says, and “the Republicans are even now still invested in trying to salvage the kernel of Trumpism.” What follows is an in-depth conversation with the election lawyer at the front lines of history.

      <title>"America’s Kind of Crazy—and it Doesn’t Go Away” -  A Conversation with Rick Perlstein, Author of Reaganland</title>
      <description>In 1977, Jimmy Carter entered the White House with as much public goodwill as any president in modern times (an 80% approval rating) on the promise of restoring decency through political restraint and shared sacrifice. Sound familiar? On this week’s episode of Inside the Hive, Joe Hagan talks to historian Rick Perlstein about the latest edition to his spectacular three-volume history of the modern right wing, Reaganland: America’s Right Turn 1976-1980, which documents the presidency of Carter and the emergence of Ronald Reagan in the wake of Watergate. When the bill came due for Carter's “ideological profligacy” of aiming to please everyone, Perlstein says, Carter crashed and Reagan rose to power on a strategy of “organized discontent,” building the reactionary coalitions that would haunt America for the next four decades. Perlstein’s history is a blueprint of the politics that brought us Trump—and a cautionary tale for President-elect Joe Biden. "We can’t change the past,” says Perlstein, "but we can live with our eyes open."

      <title>After Trump, does truth matter?: A conversation with CNN’S Jake Tapper</title>
      <description>Jake Tapper, chief Washington correspondent for CNN, returns to “Inside the Hive” for an in-depth conversation on the state of the media in these bitter, waning days of the Trump era. While Trump and his legal team spin outlandish conspiracies to reverse the legitimate election of Joe Biden, Tapper separates fact from fiction, casts skepticism on a Trump “coup,” and considers the long-term damage Trump’s war on reality has done to American life. How much is the media—including CNN—culpable for his rise? Will his political influence stay alive or decline when he finally leaves office? And will the media, addicted to the ratings his chaos provides, continue to empower him with attention?

      <title>Are we on the sunny side of the street yet?</title>
      <description>On this week’s podcast, cohosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan game out the political future of the Trump machine in the aftermath of Joe Biden’s decisive electoral victory. While Trump drums up hysteria about a coup to fan the passions of his minions—prepping, no doubt, for a right-wing media company to challenge Fox News—the rest of the media faces a reckoning: Will we continue to breathe life into Trump’s reality show by indulging his 24/7 madness with cameras and microphones? Will Jared and Ivanka manage to sneak back into Upper East Side society or will they be pecked to death by angry socialites? As the nation teeters between the political chaos of Trumpism and a cooler, saner Bidenesque calm, we have a painful postmortem to conduct, but also, for the first time in a long time, hope.

      <title>Series Finale of the Trump Show?</title>
      <description>On this week’s episode of Inside the Hive, co-hosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan ask the question: If this reality-TV presidency was scripted, how might it end? Expanding on a special project published in the Hive this week—in which Susan Orlean, Tom Perrotta, Anthony Scaramucci, Alexandra Petri and others imagine a Trump-era “finale”—the hosts bring in special guest Lee Eisenberg, former head writer of The Office (and Hive-famous financée to Fox), to discuss how a writer’s room in Hollywood might build a bookend to the series—or, as the case may be, a cliffhanger to another season of Trumpian hell. In the spirit of both hope and realism, the hosts offer advice for surviving the next week and begin (carefully) imagining post-election possibilities for a nation desperate to wean itself from Trump’s show-and-awe dopamine hits.

      <title>Can America Recover From The Trump Presidency?</title>
      <description>This week, Hive special correspondent Gabe Sherman, who has covered Donald Trump since 2015, joins cohost Joe Hagan for an in-depth discussion of the final days of the 2020 election and - possibly - the Trump era. Sherman and Hagan look past the polls to discern the narrative logic of Trump’s reality-TV presidency: As he runs out of storylines and ideas, the President of “scandal, chaos and conflict" has been bested by his biggest political competitor of the 2020 campaign: the coronavirus. Desperate to distract the public from the reality of mass death and joblessness, Trump has failed to live up to his own entertainment credo: “He’s become boring,” says Sherman. Carefully peeking past November 3rd, the two Hive reporters consider what comes next for Trump, for the media, and, more importantly, for an exhausted nation — is it possible to return to political normalcy, even under Joe Biden?

      <title>“Nationalism Will Run Roughshod Over Democracy”:  What can Nazi Germany tell us about Trump’s GOP? </title>
      <description>This week, “Inside the Hive” welcomes historian Peter Fritzsche, author of "Hitler’s First Hundred Days: When Germans Embraced the Third Reich,” to help separate fact from exaggeration on the increasingly pressing question of how much Trump’s GOP resembles the Nazis of the early 1930s. As Donald Trump attacks democratic norms and undermines the electoral process, and AG William Barr stokes fear of "a socialist path” if Trump loses, historians are hearing distressing echoes of Adolph Hitler’s rise, from the fear-mongering demonization of the left to the threat of street violence and military force against enemies real and imagined. One difference: “A white ethnic America is much more important in Trumps’ campaign than the vision of a Aryan-ized Germany was in Hitler’s electoral campaigns,” says Fritzsche, who says the MAGA conception of America "means there are villains who have undone America but now there are the virtuous who can remake America and 'make it great again.’ I call it ‘muscular melodramatic populism'”—the same phenomenon that brought Hitler to power.

      <title>Lordy, There Are Books: But Will They Matter?</title>
      <description>On this week’s Inside the Hive, Joe Hagan and Emily Jane Fox go deep into Bob Woodward's new bombshell of a book, which is all the more rattling because it is backed up by tapes of President Donald Trump himself detailing failure of leadership in the face of a global pandemic. Along with two other missives, from Michael Cohen and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, the president and his family have been caught in a tattered web of their own words at a time when they needed to be weaving their own narratives if they want to have a chance in November. The question is whether or not book sales will translate into votes, and if any of this will hold until then.

      <title> “I Really Think He is Against America”: Trump The Traitor? </title>
      <description>On this week’s “Inside the Hive,” Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan assess the state of the presidential race at the end of the long, hot 2020 summer and find themselves torn between glimmers of hope for Joe Biden in the polls and the ongoing apocalyptic tidings of Trumpism. In a feature interview, Hagan talks to longtime Republican strategist Stuart Stevens, whose best-selling book “It Was All a Lie” is a confession, a mea culpa and a searing analysis of the racism and xenophobia that has swallowed the GOP with the rise of Donald Trump, who he deems a “traitor” to his country. "I really think he is against America, what it means to be an American,” he says, blaming the Republican Party for "a complete collapse of responsibility that they had to defend democracy in America. And they failed." Stevens also offers advice on how to talk to your Trump-loving relatives about their vote in November.

        <![CDATA[<p>On this week’s “Inside the Hive,” Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan assess the state of the presidential race at the end of the long, hot 2020 summer and find themselves torn between glimmers of hope for Joe Biden in the polls and the ongoing apocalyptic tidings of Trumpism. In a feature interview, Hagan talks to longtime Republican strategist Stuart Stevens, whose best-selling book “It Was All a Lie” is a confession, a mea culpa and a searing analysis of the racism and xenophobia that has swallowed the GOP with the rise of Donald Trump, who he deems a “traitor” to his country. "I really think he is against America, what it means to be an American,” he says, blaming the Republican Party for "a complete collapse of responsibility that they had to defend democracy in America. And they failed." Stevens also offers advice on how to talk to your Trump-loving relatives about their vote in November. </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>RNC EDITION: How Much Can One Nation Take? </title>
      <description>On this week’s “Inside the Hive,” Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan parse Trump's ghastly RNC, discussing what the Trump children’s speeches tell us about the family’s inner workings and the psyche of their narcissistic paterfamilias. As the GOP tries to turn the social unrest in Wisconsin into a suburban fear factor and tie it to Joe Biden, our hosts wonder whether this week’s convention—or the DNC, for that matter—will have any lasting impact. Plus: Joe Hagan talks to author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates about his role guest editing the September issue of Vanity Fair, which focuses on the Black Lives Matter movement and the fallout from the police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Arriving in print and online during the Repulican National Convention, the issue aims directly at the heart of what’s at stake in this year’s election.

      <title>DNC SPECIAL: Is It Safe To Feel Optimistic?</title>
      <description>On this week’s “Inside the Hive,” co-hosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan discuss the four-day extravaganza of Democratic hopes and dreams and the official coming out of Joe Biden as the nominee who will face off against Donald Trump for the future of the free world. From Joe and Jill Biden’s 70s sitcom-worthy biography to Barack Obama’s cold dismantling of Trump to Kamala Harris’s intersectional feminist vision, Fox and Hagan examine the spectacle and speeches (and the musical choices) for clues to the deeper storylines and the political battles ahead. With Republicans rolling out their own program next week, our co-hosts are poised somewhere between hope and nausea.

      <title>The Crossroads:  How the GOP broke America and what to do about it</title>
      <description>On this week’s “Inside the Hive," author and journalist Kurt Andersen discusses his new book, “Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America: A Recent History,” which is both the story of how the GOP spent the last 50 years reengineering the economy to favor big business at the expense of the working class, and also a crucial primer for the 2020 election. Andersen argues that we’re at a crossroads not unlike 1980, when Reagan ushered in the rightward tilt of our economic lives, selling the idea that unfettered greed would magically lift all boats. The plan was long in the making, a counterstrike against the 1960s, and it was all too successful. To understand what must be done in a post-Trump America — which is the only America with a future — you have to understand the crucial history that brought us here.

      <title>Can Negative Ads Alone Beat Trump in November?</title>
      <description>GOP consultant and Never-Trumper John Weaver talks to “Inside the Hive” about the origins and aims of the Lincoln Project, the PAC that’s kicking out incendiary viral ads aimed at exploiting Trump’s self-regard and paranoia and keeping him on the defensive. Weaver analyzes the Biden campaign and argues that a relentless barrage of negative advertising will weaken Trump and help “clear the air” for Biden’s positive message. He also implores nervous Democrats to stop fretting and follow their lead: “They’re more worried about losing than winning,” Weaver says of Democrats. “Stop worrying about November and beat the shit out of him now.”

Also listen in for the exclusive premiere trailer to the new HBO movie, The Swamp.

      <title>How will CNN's Jake Tapper be remembered 30 years from now? </title>
      <description>This week on Inside the Hive, CNN’s Jake Tapper joins Joe Hagan for a wide-ranging conversation, from his role covering Trump to the gripping new war movie “The Outpost," based on Tapper’s 2012 nonfiction book about a harrowing battle between 53 U.S. forces and 400+ Taliban in which eight Americans were killed. Tapper talks of his emotional reaction to reports that Trump ignored intelligence about Russia paying Taliban insurgents to kill U.S. soldiers. Tapper also addresses the theory that CNN itself is partially culpable for Trump's rise and explains what motivates his reporting in a world where Watergate-sized revelations rarely move the needle of public opinion.

      <title>Could Trump Steal the 2020 Election?</title>
      <description>On this week’s Inside the Hive, cohost Joe Hagan talks to two lawyers on the front lines of the battle over the integrity of November's election. It’s a worrisome picture. Marc Elias, a veteran lawyer for the DNC, and Dale Ho of the ACLU, discuss their respective court battles to establish and protect mail-in voting and expand the rights of voters in the face of well-funded GOP efforts to limit and even purge voters, especially African-American and younger voters. Will Republicans follow Trump’s lead and restrict mail-in voting in crucial swing states as COVID-19 surges and depresses turnout? And what about the suspicious new postmaster general appointed by Trump? Joe Biden’s fear that Trump will steal the election is the daily nightmare of lawyers Elias and Ho. If Trump should challenge the results by zeroing in on mail-in votes, says Ho, “we’re really in uncharted territory.”

      <title>The Protests are changing America -- But what about Facebook?</title>
      <description>This week, cohosts Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan bring you important voices from two fronts of the ongoing struggle for justice after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. First, Fox interviews Maya Wiley, the Brooklyn-based civil rights activist and MSNBC legal analyst, who dissects and interprets the murder charges against four policemen involved in the killing, and explains how to reform policing in this country. Next, Joe Hagan interviews Brandi Collins-Dexter, the senior campaign director for Color of Change, the largest online civil rights group in America, to discuss the group’s years-long battle with Facebook over hate speech and disinformation, including the company’s attempts to discredit their work and last week’s contentious talks with Mark Zuckerberg about removing the President’s incendiary lies from the site.

      <title>The Fresh Prince of Kalorama: A Jared Kushner Roundtable </title>
      <description>Kushner, the President's son-in-law, is one of the Trump West Wing's only survivors, having outwitted, outplayed, and outlasted his rivals as he stayed in his father-in-law's good graces while keeping an eye on his comically large portfolio. But before he was finding peace in the Middle East, defining the Republican agenda, and handling a global pandemic, he was a lowly newspaper publisher. On this week's *Inside the Hive*, co-host Emily Jane Fox sits down with Tom McGeveran, Elizabeth Spiers, and *Vanity Fair's* own Michael Calderone, all former *New York Observer*-ites, to talk about Kushner's attitude towards the press, his favorite band and books, his arguing style and value system, and what he'll do next.

      <title>"We made this movie to be on the big screen": Director Jon Chu Bets On a Post-Pandemic Hollywood</title>
      <description>On this week’s episode, Joe Hagan talks to Crazy Rich Asians director Jon Chu and film editor Myron Kerstein to discuss the wrenching decision to push their new tent-pole film, the Lin Manuel Miranda musical In the Heights, to summer 2021 instead of opening on a streaming service. With movie production in Hollywood halted, studios and the producers, directors, actors and film crews they employ are groping for answers as to how films get made again, where their next paychecks will come from, and whether audiences will ever return to theaters in the numbers they once did. Jon Chu is betting that theater-goers will come back once the crisis has passed: "I have to believe in that. I can't give up. I can't give up on that dream. And so our job is to give reasons for it to exist."

      <title>Trump, Masks, and Sourdough: The Coronavirus Round Table</title>
      <description>After 150 episodes, Nick Bilton is handing over the reigns of Inside the Hive to Vanity Fair’s Emily Jane Fox and Joe Hagan. In today’s episode, all three join together for a round-table discussion on Trump’s attempt to blame everyone—from Barack Obama to the World Health Organization—for his floundering response to COVID-19; how Joe Biden and the Democrats should respond; and if Americans have too much freedom (and an aversion to wearing masks) to truly stop the spread until there’s a cure. Stick around for a little heart-to-heart at the end, and—of course—a brief discussion about making sourdough bread in the middle of the apocalypse.

      <title>On the Frontlines of COVID-19: A Nurse, A Governor and A Journalist</title>
      <description>On this week's Inside the Hive we talk to Sydney Gressel, a nurse at UCSF's Benioff Hospital in San Francisco who has started a new nonprofit to help feed doctors and nurses around the country as they fight on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. Then, Vanity Fair contributor Joe Hagan sits down with Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker to parse the Trump White House’s missteps in fighting the virus and how the state is trying to combat the disease. Finally, Nick sits down with Sarah Frier, a reporter for Bloomberg, to discuss her new book, "No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram," which gets into the details of how Instagram went from a scrappy startup to the most important social network in the world, and what tech companies are doing to help stop misinformation around COVID-19.

Burns, the writer of the film, and Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, join Nick to explain how much of the research that went into the film is playing out in real time; how the states and countries that ignore social distancing will pay the ultimate price; why this particularly insidious virus is unlike anything we've seen in recent history; and how an FDA-approved vaccine could take a lot less time than we’ve been told.

      <description>What brought Hope Hicks back into the fold? Why have Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg succeeded, while Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have failed (so far)?

      <title>Impeachment, Iowa, and the Week from Hell  </title>
      <description>Trump didn't get impeached! Iowa was a disaster! A virus is getting ready to destroy humanity! What's next? Bess Levin, a columnist for Vanity Fair, joins Nick to discuss why this week sucked so much, why the economy still hasn't gone into a Trump-induced recession, whether this is all part of Mike Bloomberg's master plan, and why Donald Trump Jr. not being hugged enough as a child means he’ll probably be president one day. Oh, and stick around until the end when Nick surprises Levin with the most difficult question ever asked on Inside the Hive.

      <title>Knives Out: The Democratic Primary Is About to Get Messy</title>
      <description>It’s finally here! No, the impeachment—we’re talking about the Iowa Caucus. After what feels like 30 years of speculation (but has really been three), Jordan Brown, a political consultant and fundraiser who has spent time on the ground with almost all of the Democratic nominees, joins Nick to explain how the Democratic primary could play out from Iowa to New Hampshire to Super Tuesday, why the country is at its biggest crossroads in history, and whether impeachment, which likely won’t end in Trump’s removal, will help or hinder his prospects of winning a second term.

Gabriel Sherman, special correspondent for Vanity Fair, joins Nick to explain how this all went down inside the Trump White House, why anti-immigration scribe Steven Miller still has a job, why Don Jr. will go on to run for office, but Ivanka won't, and—perhaps most importantly—what Donald J. Trump told a Republican pollster last week when asked what the "J" in his middle name stood for.

      <description>Thanks to the rise of the smartphone, the last decade saw the most dramatic technological change in centuries. Over the next ten years, the same thing will happen to science, healthcare, and space travel. D.A. Wallach, a former rockstar turned biotech investor, joins Nick to kick off the year by debating the scientific predictions for the next decade, including whether we will soon be able to print human organs, if healthcare will become so advanced that living past 100 will become routine, or if only the rich will be afforded such advancements, and whether humans will live on Mars by 2030.

      <title>Was Boeing the Start of the A.I. Apocalypse?</title>

Should we be worried the same thing could happen with driverless cars, drones, and delivery robots in the not-too-distant future? Clive Thompson, author of the new book, “Coders,” joins Nick to explain what we can do to stop cyberterrorists or a rogue nation from using code instead of bombs to kill us all.

Emily Jane Fox joins Nick to explain why it’s actually a good thing that Trump isn’t a secret Russian spy, and how this actually might be the best thing to happen to the Democrats since the election of Donald Trump. And, finally, will the Mueller Report leak? And if so, when and by whom?

      <title>Why @AOC Scares the S**t Out of Republicans</title>
      <description>This week Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stirred up the Republican Party when she warned that that if we don’t solve the climate crisis in 12 years, the Earth could be doomed.

William Poundstone, author of the upcoming book, The Doomsday Calculation, joins Nick to explain how such an algorithm does exits, can predict all of this and more, and why humans likely only have 760 years left in the universe.

      <title>Is Facebook Becoming Marlboro?</title>
      <description>Being a tech company in Silicon Valley could be bad for your health, and the health of your company. Jason Fried, author of the book, "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work," joins Nick to explain why, as the CEO of a successful startup, he stays as far away from the tech epicenter as possible. He explains why technology has become more of a hindrance than a solution at the office, and home, when A,I. will really start taking jobs, and how evil Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, and other social networks have become. Fried likens them to cigarette companies two decades ago, where the CEOs were fully aware that they were making something bad for our health and society, but did it anyway.

Abby Tracy, reporter for the Hive, joins Nick to explain what happened this week, what will happen when the Democrats take the house next year, and if Donald J. Trump will find himself in the center crosshairs of Mueller‘s investigation.

Anand Giridharadas joins Nick to explain how elites are destroying the world, how philanthropy is a fallacy designed to keep the poor poor, on the rich richer, and how inequality in the U.S. is likely going to lead to a revolution, if it hasn’t already, and why Giridharadas believes the poor have been duped into voting for social issues (like abortion and gay rights) but in doing so, are voting against themselves economically.

      <title>The Tech Mess Trump Won't Clean Up</title>
      <description>As America tears itself apart over social issues, like Roe vs Wade and whether to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, technology could soon make things even worse in this country. Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box, joins Nick to discuss potential massive job loss, gross inequality and A.I. being used against America with the power of digital nuclear bombs. As Levie and Nick discuss, Silicon Valley has shown that it is incapable of seeing how the future can be used against us, and yet Donald Trump and his administration are oblivious (or don't care) about what's coming next. Stick around after the show, when Jon Kelly joins Nick to voice their dismay over the GOP, and discuss the Vanity Fair New Establishment list.

      <title>The Kavanaugh Monstrosity</title>
      <description>It's been decades since there has been a Supreme Court hearing like Brett Kavanaugh's, and yet, the outcome could end up being exactly the same as Anita Hill's testimony. 

Vanity Fair's Emily Jane Fox joins Nick to discuss why Kavanaugh will likely still be a Supreme Court Justice, and why Christine Blasey Ford's testimony was so important to the #MeToo movement. 

After the show, Nick and Jon Kelly talk about the abrupt exodus of Instagram co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mikey Krieger, and what Facebook will do with its photo platform when Mark Zuckerberg gains complete control.

      <description>A decade ago this week, America officially entered the worst financial collapse since The Great Depression. Now, as Donald Trump rolls back regulations meant to protect consumers, some fear that we are about to see another housing collapse? Spencer Rascoff, the CEO of Zillow, joins Nick to discuss this and everything housing-related, from the future of the industry to how most poor and middle class Americans have been priced out of buying a home. Then Nick and Jon Kelly discuss this week in Trumpland, and how the White House is in a feverish state of tumult after the release of the Bob Woodward book, "Fear."

      <title>Which Trump(s) Will Go to the Clink?</title>
      <description>Will Donny Jr. be indicted for lying to Congress? Does Michael Cohen sleep with one eye open? Will Paul Manafort spend the rest of his life in jail, or be pardoned by his old buddy, POTUS? Will Trump's downfall come from his infidelities? And speaking of, how does Melania feel about all of this? 

Emily Jane Fox, a senior reporter for Vanity Fair, and author of the book Born Trump, joins Nick to explain what is going to happen to The Trump inner circle over the next 18 months, and also why Mr. Magoo, also known as Jeff Sessions, has finally started to fight back against the President of the United States.

      <title>The Coming Trump Recession</title>
      <description>Could a Trump impeachment destroy the economy, or save it? Is Trump's trade war with China going to usher in a new recession? Will Trump's deregulation end up screwing over consumers, who could lose their jobs, homes, and retirement? Mary Childs, a senior reporter for Barron's magazine, joins Nick to answer all the questions about the economy that keep us up at night. Childs also discusses how Elon Musk's erratic behavior is perceived on Wall Street, and that if he was a woman, he would have been fired long ago.

      <title>You Won’t Believe Trump’s Biggest Regret</title>
      <description>It’s been a few weeks since Donald Trump signed an executive order reversing his diabolical decision to separate children and parents at the border, but the story is far from over. Jacob Soboroff, correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, who helped break the child separation story open, joins Nick to explain what will happen to the hundred of children who have still not been reunited with their parents, why Trump officials regret giving in to pressures from the left and the right to stop their policy, and what the administration is planning next that could be much, much worse.

      <title>Inside the Alex Jones Debacle</title>
      <description>Do this week’s voter numbers in Ohio, and elsewhere, foreshadow a blue wave? Is Donald Trump actually the Republican party’s most powerful weapon, or its Achilles’ heel?

Stay tuned after the show for Nick and Jon Kelly, who discuss Elon Musk’s bid to take Tesla private, if Snap will be bought, and why Jack Dorsey wants to protect Alex Jones more than the parent’s of slain kids.

      <title>How Silicon Valley Turned Evil</title>
      <description>Technology has a history of starting out with good intentions, and eventually being leveraged for quite the opposite. On this week’s episode, Adam Fisher, author of Valley of Genius, joins Nick to explain how Silicon Valley--an industry created to advance war research and governmental capacities--was co-opted for commercial, and often sinister, purposes, from election-meddling operatives to racist trolls. Fisher also explains what Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk can learn from their predecessors, before they destroy the world.

      <title>Did RFK’s Assasination Pave the Way for Trump?</title>
      <description>On the face of it, it seems like America is currently more divided than anytime since the Civil War. But back in 1968, America was embroiled in chaos, torn over the war in Vietnam, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and later, the murder of Robert Kennedy, the brother of JFK. Marc Smerling and Zac Stuart-Pontier, the team behind Crimetown and The Jinx, join Nick to explain how the murder of RFK, in 1968, might have been a government conspiracy, and why it changed the shape of America forever. Also: Vanity Fair’s Abby Tracy explains what’s going to happen with Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s Supreme Court pick, and what the Democrats can do to stop the court from overturn Roe vs Wade.

      <title>Has Putin Fixed the World Cup?</title>
      <description>A few years ago, a chance encounter between Christopher Steele, of the now-famous Steele Dossier, and an FBI agent who was working on a gambling case at Trump Tower, opened the door to a multi-year investigation into the massive corruption taking place at FIFA, the soccer federation. Ken Bensinger, author of the new book, “Red Card: How the U.S. Blew the Whistle on the World's Biggest Sports Scandal,” joins us to tell a wild and crazy story that involves the mob, British spies, a 450-pound informant who gets around on a mobility scooter with a parrot on his shoulder, Vladimir Putin, Robert Mueller, a soccer-obsessed IRS agent in Orange County, and tangentially, none other than Donald Trump. We also discuss if Putin might have already fixed who will win this year’s World Cup. Hint: Russia.

      <title>Is Ivanka a Bigger Liar Than Her Daddy?</title>
      <description>While Americans watched in horror as innocent children, as young as 9-months-old, were torn from their parents arms, Ivanka Trump was posting photos of her and her children, as happy as could be. Is she oblivious? A mean girl? Or is she unable to speak publicly about how she really feels out of fear of her father? Emily Jane Fox, author of the new book, Born Trump: Inside America’s First Family, joins Nick to talk about what Ivanka and her brothers, Donny Jr. and Eric, are really like in person. She offers salacious and wild stories about how these children grew up, about whether they liked each other, and if they really care about how their dad is ruining the country. Also: Nick and Jon Kelly talk about how Russia is planning to disrupt the 2018 and 2020 elections, and why Bob Iger is happy spending tens of billions of dollars on Fox.

      <description>Robby Mook, former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, joins Nick this week to discuss how Russian is planning to drive more discourse in our democracy, and the 2018 election. Mook also discusses how the Republican party is simply a rubber stamp for Trump, afraid of what he might do or say to them; and who the Democratics will elect in 2020. Finally, Mook talks about the best and worst times during the 2016 campaign, and what he and his old boss, Hillary, still text each about.

      <title>‘’Sociopathic Tendencies”: Inside Elizabeth Holmes’ Colossal Disgrace</title>
      <description>Silicon Valley is notoriously full of founders who exaggerate, intentionally lie to the media, and dupe investors, and even Congress. But there are few stories that rival the fraud behind Theranos, the blood-testing company once worth $10 billion, and now worth nothing. John Carreyrou, author of a new book, "Bad Blood," joins us to explain how the company's CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, defrauded everyone who came into her orbit, how she might still end up behind bars, and he answers the question on everyone's mind: Is Holmes a sociopath?

Nick Bilton sits down with Tom Conrad, former product director of Snap and co-founder of Pandora, to discuss Nick's book, “American Kingpin;” if Silicon Valley CEOs are moral at heart, or more concerned with their profits and their legacy; and if Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road website, is any different from other CEOs in tech.

Carroll, a cosmologist and physicist specializing in dark energy and general relativity, joins Nick to answer the questions that plague us all, including, if there's a chance that somewhere out there in the cosmos, there is another extraterrestrial Donald Trump ruling over a planet of little green aliens.

      <title>The Conservative Case Against Trump</title>
      <description>Donald Trump has always been a blatant liar, making up stories about his worth to how many people were at his inauguration, but do people actually like it when Trump lies to them? Amanda Carpenter, author of a new book, "Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies To Us," joins Nick to talk about why Republicans, and evangelicals, still love Trump, even after all these lies, how Trump actually pulls off these outright deceptions, and why they are only going to get worse in 2020 as Trump does everything possible to try and maintain control of the White House.

Amanda Carpenter, author of a new book, "Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies To Us," joins Nick to talk about why Republicans, and evangelicals, still love Trump, even after all these lies, how Trump actually pulls off these outright deceptions, and why they are only going to get worse in 2020 as Trump does everything possible to try and maintain control of the White House.

      <title>How Evil is Silicon Valley?</title>
      <description>As of late, tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google, are being perceived as evil for taking advantage of our deepest, darkest secrets and fears with one goal: to make us click on more invasive ads. Tristan Harris, who has been described as "the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience," is trying to change that. But can an industry worth trillions of dollars, with some of the biggest egos in business, ever change to do the right thing?

      <title>The Magic Tricks to Beat Trump in 2020</title>
      <description>The only reason that magic tricks actually work, according to the world famous magician and puzzle-maker David Kwong, is that “people want to believe.” The same theory applies to politics, fake news, and the entire tricks that Trump used to win the White House. Kwong joins us this week to share fascinating stories about magicians playing an integral role in war efforts, clandestine government operations, and yes, politics. In part two of this week’s show, Nick talks about his latest feature in Vanity Fair, about Russian, Chinese and domestic spies working in Silicon Valley.

Jamil Smith, a writer for The New Republic, Time, and now, Rolling Stone, joins us to explain why, 155 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, black men are arrested for just sitting in Starbucks coffee shop, why President Obama could have done more to speak out against these issues, and why we’re all so sick and tired of hearing about James Comey.

      <title>The Most Hated Man in Silicon Valley</title>
      <description>Ryan Holiday, author of the new book "Conspiracy," tells the inside story of how Peter Thiel took down Gawker Media and Nick Denton, how the tech billionaire's relationship with Donald Trump isn't what it used to be, and why we should kind of — just a little bit — feel sorry for Thiel, even though he is one of the most disliked people in Silicon Valley.

      <title>What Will Kill Us First: Trump or Technology?</title>
      <description>Will robots kill us all? Will a rogue A.I. shut off the power grids? Could we lose track of what is real, and what is not, in a permanently augmented reality? My guest today, Kevin Kelly, has spent his entire career (accurately) predicting what tomorrow will look like, and quelling the fears that come with each new technology. He offers a prediction of what culture, society and politics will look like over the next thirty years, and if humanity will survive a technological apocalypse.

      <title>The Great Trump Recession?</title>
      <description>Description: For the last year, Trump has bragged about the rise of the stock market, taking credit for every upswing since Obama left office. Yet this week, when the bottom fell out of the market, Trump blamed — yep — the media. Bess Levin, The Hive’s Wall Street corespondent, explains why this could be the beginning of the recession we’ve all been expecting, how Trump will try to blame everyone else for the declines, and she helps rank the Trump administration’s finance appointees in order of worst, dumb, and the devil himself.

      <title>How Trump F**cked Democracy</title>
      <description>It really is even worse than you thought, notes David Cay Johnston, author of a new book with a slightly more elegant title. Johnston explains how Trump is systematically, and intentionally, dismantling the way the U.S. government works to help boost his own ego. From Scott Pruitt rolling back regulations that will destory the environment, to Betsy DeVos disemboweling the country's education system, the actions of the Trump administration are going to have devastating impacts on the next generation. But Johnston does have one glimmer of hope...

      <title>The Threat Worse Than Trump</title>
      <description>Donald Trump has turned back more climate-related safety measures in the past year than any president in history. Jeff Orlowski, the Oscar short-listed filmmaker behind "Chasing Coral" and "Chasing Ice," joins us to lay out the implications of our warming planet, how most of the coral reefs on earth are dying, and why that is even more terrifying than you think. Orlowski explains that we could be at the beginning of the sixth mass extinction.

      <title>How Donald Trump Could Crush Facebook</title>
      <description>The Hive’s tech reporter and millennial expert, Maya Kosoff, joins us to explain why the government may soon start regulating social media companies, why you should delete Facebook from your phone ASAP, whether Snap will survive the assault of Mark Zuckerberg, and why the White House should build a “fake” alternate Twitter that only Trump sees, replete with fake likes and fake retweets, and maybe even a fake Oval Office.

      <title>Let's Meet Some Robots!</title>
      <description>At this year's CES in Las Vegas, robots of all shapes and sizes were on display. There were robots that can fold your clothes, others that can clean your windows, walk your dog or make you an omelet. There were social robots and butler robots. Big robots and little bitty robots. On this week's show, we went to Vegas and talked to two experts about the world of tomorrow, hearing how robotics, driverless cars, and artificial intelligence are going to change everything we touch and do in the not-too-distant future.

      <description>Terrified by Trump's latest nuclear tweet? Worried that Kim Jung-Un might fall asleep on his little button and blow us all up? This podcast will probably terrify you even more. Kal Raustiala, Director of the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations, and an expert on foreign affairs and international law, joins me this week to explain how close we are to global annihilation, why artificial intelligence could prove to be more dangerous than a global thermonuclear war, and why California should just call it quits and secede from the union.

      <title>Will We Finally Stop Talking About Trump in 2018?</title>
      <description>If you think 2017 was tough to get through, just wait until next year. In the year’s final podcast, Nick Bilton and Jon Kelly offer predictions for 2018. Among them: Will the Dems actually win back the House? Will Bitcoin still be around 12 months from now? Could the #meToo movement finally reach the shores of Silicon Valley? And will Trump finally begin his inevitable passage into oblivion?

      <title>This Podcast Could Make You Filthy Rich!</title>
      <description>Here's a fact for you: If you bought $1 — yes, one single dollar — of Bitcoin in March, 2013, it would be worth $6 million today. Joyce Kim, who has been in the cryptocurrency game since the very beginning, joins us this week to explain what is really going on with all these digital currencies, why they are rising so rapidly, if you should own them (or if you already do, if you should sell them), if there's a Bitcoin Bubble, and why all the nerds in Silicon Valley can't stop talking about this digital gold.

      <title>How to Beat Donald Trump at Twitter</title>
      <description>Tim Wu might be the most prescient person in tech: he invented the term “net neutrality,” and predicted the global dominance the Internet would have on society. He joins us this week to explain why Facebook is the most likely tech company to be regulated by the government, how Donald Trump used technology to hijack our attention (and how we’ll all reclaim it back), what happens now that net neutrality has been rolled back, and why everyone should spend at least one week alone in the desert.

      <title>Forget the Dow, Trump Is About to Trigger Financial Armageddon</title>
      <description>Each week, the stock market reaches all-time highs, and Donald Trump takes all the credit. But is his insanity and destruction going to lead to a crash of biblical proportions, or possibly to a recession akin to 2008? My guest this week, William D. Cohan, a former banker-turned journalist, seems to think so. Hear him explain why Wall Street should be worried by the actions of the man they hate, and how everyday Americans are going to be affected.

      <title>Even America's Top Expert on God Can't Explain Donald Trump</title>
      <description>For the past two decades, Reza Aslan has been studying religions from all over the globe, and talking to people who believe in one God, many Gods, or no God at all. He joins us this week to explain the origins of belief, why faith is ultimately a good thing for society, and how he got fired from CNN for calling Donald Trump a “piece of s**t.”

(A spokesperson for CNN declined to comment on Aslan’s depiction of his dismissal.)

      <title>This Podcast Will Scare You To Death (Seriously)</title>
      <description>Do Donald Trump's provocations of Kim Jong-Un have you scared? You might not be scared enough. Right now, U.S. generals are performing war games exploring how to retaliate in the event of a nuclear attack on American soil. Other government employees are evaluating what would happen if Russian hackers knocked out our power grids; others still are trying to stop ISIS from recruiting a new generation of suicide fighters on Twitter; meanwhile, the Navy Seals are slowly becoming obsolete in a virtual world of ubiquitous and disruptive terror. 




Haroon Ullah, who spent nearly a decade at The State Department, and recently authored the book Digital World War, joins us to explain how close we really are to World War III, how modern day warfare is unlike anything we've seen before, and why America is losing its standing on the world stage.

      <title>Can We Turn Texas Blue?</title>
      <description>After the Democratic wins in New Jersey and Virginia, this week, could Texas become increasingly blue in 2018? 

Jay Hulings, who is running to repressent the state’s 23rd congressional district, joins us to explain how The Lone Star state could become a blue state (or at least purple) next year, how people along the Rio Grande really feel about “The Wall,” and why, as a gun-loving Democrat, people like him could re-write the future of the left.

      <title>Imagine Jared Kushner is Your Boss…</title>
      <description>Kyle Pope spent 18 months running the New York Observer under Jared Kusher. In that time, he was forced to contend with more problems than he had ever anticipated when he took the job. Jared's father (who Jared calls "daddy") allegedly wanted his son to order "hit pieces" on bankers he didn't like; Jared's mother complained about the decor in people's offices and tried to have a rug removed; and on one occasion, Kyle was forced to have a sit down with The Donald himself. Pope joins us today to tell these stories and more, and explain what the future might look like for Jared and Ivanka when this all comes crashing down.

      <title>And Then There Were Four</title>
      <description>The past decade has seen the biggest disruption in American business in a hundred years — and its only just the beginning. Scott Galloway, author of the new book “The Four,” joins me to explain how Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, grew into such massive companies. He lays out which of them is the least likely to survive (ahem, Facebook), and why those that do (ahem, Amazon) may end up in a war with the U.S. governments over regulation.
