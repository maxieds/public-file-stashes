      <title>'Maus' author Art Spiegelman on book banning; What the asteroid sample may reveal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., has been indicted on federal corruption charges. He is accused of accepting bribes and influencing an arms deal with Egypt, among other things. Brent Johnson of the New Jersey Star-Ledger tells us more. And, NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission capsule contains an 8.8-ounce asteroid sample that could help scientists worldwide learn more about the solar system's origins. We speak to Dani Mendoza DellaGiustina, the deputy principal investigator for the mission. Then, the American Library Association has dubbed next week, Oct. 1 through Oct. 7, as Banned Book Week, a time to celebrate reading and fight censorship. One author targeted by book banning is Pulitzer Prize winner Art Spiegelman, who wrote the graphic novel "Maus" as a memoir of his family's experiences during the time of Nazi Germany. Spiegelman talks about the potent irony of having a book about the rise of the Nazis being banned.]]></description>

Al Jazeera's Malik Traina talks about the devastating flooding in eastern Libya.

Then, Project 2025 aims to dramatically reshape federal agencies, reduce their independence, and give more power to the president if a Republican wins in 2024.

      <title>Asylum seekers in peril at the Southern border; NFL football is back. So is betting</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border are often subject to arbitrary decisions made by border patrol agents who decide whether they can enter the country or not. And in Texas, a federal judge ruled Gov. Greg Abbott's floating barrier in Rio Grande. Reporter Lillian Perlmutter and Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, join us. And, as more companies return to in-office work requirements, the future of remote work is uncertain. Callum Borchers, columnist at the Wall Street Journal, joins us to explain what happens next. Then, the NFL football season kicks off on Thursday as the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Detroit Lions. With the return of football comes the return of sports betting, now legal in two-thirds of states. But there's a darker side to the industry.

      <title>The perfect playlist to wind down the summer; Nat Myers releases album 'Yellow Peril'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Alt.Latino co-hosts Anamaria Artemisa Sayre and Felix Contreras offer a playlist of songs they can't stop listening to from Kumbia Queers to Tainy. And, what makes a track the song of the summer? It has to be "capable of changing the nation's psychic temperature," according to music critic Chris Richards. We look back at songs of the summer dating back to the 1960s with NPR music critic Ann Powers. Then, Nat Myers is putting a new twist on some of America's oldest music. The Korean-American musician's new blues album is called "Yellow Peril," and he describes himself as "a young Asian cat playing old Black music."]]></description>

Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer joins us to talk about what the indictment means, and former Georgia district attorney Gwen Keyes Fleming discusses the legal strengths and weaknesses.

      <title>Maui recovers from deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century; Coal's future in Kentucky</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In Hawaii, residents are mourning after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than 100 years killed at least 96 people. Bill Dorman of Hawai'i Public Radio shares the latest. And Kekoa McClellan, a spokesperson representing hotel industries in Maui, talks about the future of the industry and how workers are faring after the deadly fires. Then, a small newspaper in central Kansas underwent a raid by local police, resulting in the seizure of computers, cell phones and servers of reporters and editors. Emily Bradbury of the Kansas Press Association tells us about how the illegal raid has raised concern over First Amendment rights. Plus, the world's appetite for coal is dimming as we grapple with the effects of climate change. But the communities in Kentucky that have mined it for generations are struggling to adapt.

      <title>American credit card debt passes $1 trillion; Maui wildfires</title>
      <description><![CDATA[At least 36 people are dead on Maui as wildfires continue to burn, forcing thousands of people to flee and destroying hundreds of structures in the historic town of Lahaina. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser's Dan Nakaso shares the latest. Plus, we're joined by Laren Gartner who owns Cheeseburger in Paradise, a business that burned down in Lahaina, Hawaii. And, American credit card debt passed $1 trillion this week. It's another milestone that appears alarming on the surface â€” but what is the story behind that debt? The Washington Post's Michelle Singletary tells us. Then, Jordannah Elizabeth talks about her book for middle school readers, "A Child's Introduction to Hip-Hop: The Beats, Rhymes and Roots of a Musical Revolution."]]></description>

And, does it matter, legally, whether or not former President Donald Trump believed the lies he told about the 2020 election? Can ignorance be a defense? Harvard University's Laurence Tribe weighs in. Then, attempting to multitask usually ends in a worse outcome and can negatively impact our mental health.

      <description><![CDATA[WABE's Sam Gringlas talks about the investigation into former President Donald Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.
