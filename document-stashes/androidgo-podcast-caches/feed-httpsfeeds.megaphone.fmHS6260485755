      <title>Bad news: Surge pricing is here to stay </title>
      <description>You know the drill: You’re caught in a downpour, and open your Uber app to see that a ride home will cost 4x its normal price. That practice of surge pricing — when demand goes up, so do the prices — is already a part of the hotel and flight booking experience, but it’s about to expand even deeper into our lives. Plus: Dollar General in trouble and Neuralink moves forward.

      <title>Why free stuff makes us crazy</title>
      <description>Why do we care so much when a crummy t-shirt gets shot out of a cannon at a sporting event? It's all about the power of "free," a price point that makes us feel high and act so irrationally that we forget that even free stuff comes with a cost.

In this special episode of The Hustle Daily Show, we’re taking a look at how getting stuff for “free” affects consumer behavior. And to really get at the heart of the story here, we’re going to focus on 3 wildly different areas: free grocery store samples, free shipping, and free online content.

Join our host Zachary Crockett and guest, Mark Dent (Writer at The Hustle) as they take you through our most interesting stories of the day.

      <title>What’s driving the debt crisis? with Ray Dalio</title>
      <description>Ray Dalio is the founder and co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater, the largest hedge fund in the world. He’s one of the 100 richest people on Earth. He’s also a best-selling author.

In today’s episode, Zachary Crockett chats with Dalio about his latest book, “The Changing World Order,” which uses a historical lens to examine why empires rise and fall — and why the US may be showing some signs of decline.

We cover a range of topics about the economy and Dalio’s life, including:

The 3 biggest issues America is facing right now

What’s driving the debt crisis

The growing wealth gap (and what we should do about it)

Thoughts on inflation and an impending recession

What to invest in during times of volatility

Whether or not crypto can become a reserve currency

Dalio’s worst failures as an investor

Common traits of successful people

The role luck plays in reaching the top

How Dalio helped McDonald’s launch chicken nuggets
