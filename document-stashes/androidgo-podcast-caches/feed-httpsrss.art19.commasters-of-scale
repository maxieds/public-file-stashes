      <itunes:summary>The buzz about AI focuses on how we can bolster our skills, knowledge and efficiency. But what role can AI play in enriching our lives as social beings with feelings, relationships and dreams? 

In this special interview, Mustafa Suleyman and Reid Hoffman — co-founders of Inflection AI, and two of the leading AI minds today — sit down to discuss the human-centered ideals at the core of Mustafa's cutting-edge work. They offer a clear eyed, optimistic view on how AI will revolutionize our lives.

Mustafa discusses his early experiences with AI, his pioneering work with DeepMind and Google, and the ideals that were central in creating the AI Assistant, Pi. He also discusses how we should be actively creating the future that we want to see, as outlined in his recent book, The Coming Wave. 

This interview is also the ideal primer for our upcoming miniseries "AI and You," in which Reid will talk with an array of AI leaders (including Mustafa) to explore how you can harness AI to scale your productivity, your business, and yourself, while staying safe in the process.

      <title>62. The 4 core principles of crisis management, w/Ellen Kullman (DuPont, Carbon)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>To survive a crisis, you have to double down on who you already are as a company. This is something Ellen Kullman knows, having led DuPont through the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and taken the CEO role at 3D-printing unicorn Carbon only weeks before Covid hit. Through her years as a leader, Ellen has developed four crisis principles that allowed her to lead teams and thrive through pandemic, economic meltdown, and beyond. The key? Practicing the principles in calmer times, before crisis hits. Because as Reid says: there's no such thing as a crisis playbook. There's just your playbook. Cameos: Amy Shira Teitel (spaceflight historian), Jonah Peretti (BuzzFeed), Brian Chesky (Airbnb), Neil Blumenthal (Warby Parker), Stacy Brown-Philpot (TaskRabbit).</p><p>Read a transcript of this episode: <a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Rapid Response: Loneliness at work, w/Noreena Hertz,  author of The Lonely Century</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>This is the loneliest century, says economist Noreena Hertz. Even before the pandemic forced us to stay home, loneliness was snaking its way through our lives, affecting everything from how we vote to how we work. Professor at University College London and author of the book, The Lonely Century, Noreena has some sage advice for businesses: about how less loneliness fuels more productivity, the bottom-line advantages of in-person connection over virtual interactions, and why values like kindness, community, and care are key to attracting and retaining talent.

      <title>47. Bill Gates: How to accelerate history (Part 1)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>How did Bill Gates scale BOTH a global business and a global philanthropy? He spotted an inflection point in history — and accelerated it. What does that take? A great idea, great timing, and also: Great partners. Because even Bill Gates doesn’t go it alone. In Part 1 of this special two-part episode, Bill reflects with Reid on the founding and growth of Microsoft — how he not only spotted an inflection point (hello, personal computers) but accelerated it to massive scale (forget computers, let's talk platforms). There’s timeless wisdom in Bill’s ability to identify inflection points, build strategic partnerships, and just work harder than everyone else. In&nbsp;Part 2, Bill reflects on scaling the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the different lessons learned between the two.</p><p>Listen to Part 2: <a href="https://listen.mastersofscale.com/Bill-Gates-Part-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://listen.mastersofscale.com/Bill-Gates-Part-2</a></p><p>Read a transcript of this interview:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

If you want your company to truly scale, you first have to do things that don't scale. Handcraft the core experience. Get your hands dirty. Serve your customers one-by-one. And don't stop until you know exactly what they want. That's what Brian Chesky did. As CEO of Airbnb, Brian’s early work was more akin to a traveling salesman. He takes us back to his lean years — when he went door-to-door, meeting Airbnb hosts in person — and shares the imaginative route to crafting what he calls an "11-star experience.”

      <title>78. Tyra Banks: Personal brand power</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>To succeed in the modern business environment, you need to strut your stuff: to cultivate a personal brand that supports career growth. No one represents this better than Tyra Banks. As a model, a producer, and an entrepreneur, Tyra has forged a personal brand that has enabled her to make multiple pivots, building fame, wealth, and meaningful impact on the issues that matter most to her.

      <title>73. The secret power of onboarding, w/Canva's Melanie Perkins</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Onboarding isn't just about employees. The often overlooked step-by-step process — to join a product or company — lays the foundation for everything that follows. No one knows this better than Melanie Perkins, co-founder and CEO of Canva. From the moment she started the Australia-based graphic design platform, she knew she had to engage newcomers with simplicity and speed. It took a series of steps: onboard users to her product, one-by-one; onboard investors to help her build; onboard employees in a way that would pass along her values and her vision. Then onboard new investors, new features, new partners, new markets with the same care and ease-of-use — but at scale. With more than 40 million monthly active users and 3 billion designs created, Canva is proof for the magic of onboarding.

Their new book,&nbsp;<em>Level Up: Rise Above the Hidden Forces Holding Your Business Back</em>, dives into the lessons learned from those experiences. She also founded and scaled two voting rights organizations: the New Georgia Project and Fair Fight Action, as well as the census mobilization effort Fair Count and the Southern Economic Advancement Project.</p><p>Read <a href="https://amzn.to/36bw5Ay" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Level Up: Rise Above the Hidden Forces Holding Your Business Back</em></a><em>, </em>by Stacey Abrams and Lara Hodgson</p><p>Read a transcript of this episode:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

As Rachel says, the companies that aren’t planning for their future demographics of consumers will “age out really quickly.” She spoke with Rapid Response host Bob Safian about diving into future ideas that may first appear unrealistic – and spinning them into realities.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>You’ve had a glimpse into the future, and you’re sitting on an idea that could change the world. Now what? Well, prepare for layers of resistance, and be ready to spring into action.

      <title>Rapid Response: Be relentless – so your team can be fearless, w/Planned Parenthood’s Alexis McGill Johnson</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Faced with long odds, how do you keep your team motivated and moving forward? As a leader, Alexis McGill Johnson is focused on building hope. As the president of Planned Parenthood, Johnson is preparing for the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.

      <title>66. The 4 core principles of crisis management, w/Ellen Kullman (DuPont, Carbon)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>To survive a crisis, you have to double down on who you already are as a company. This is something Ellen Kullman knows, having led DuPont through the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and taken the CEO role at 3D-printing unicorn Carbon only weeks before Covid hit. Through her years as a leader, Ellen has developed four crisis principles that allowed her to lead teams and thrive through pandemic, economic meltdown, and beyond. The key? Practicing the principles in calmer times, before crisis hits. Because as Reid says: there's no such thing as a crisis playbook. There's just your playbook. Cameos: Amy Shira Teitel (spaceflight historian), Jonah Peretti (BuzzFeed), Brian Chesky (Airbnb), Neil Blumenthal (Warby Parker), and Stacy Brown-Philpot (TaskRabbit).</p><p>Read a transcript of this interview at:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/ellen-kullman/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/ellen-kullman/</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>99. Leap before you look, w/Marc Lore (Jet.com)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Marc Lore is all too familiar with leaping into the unknown. He’s made leaps of faith as the founder of Diapers.com, Jet.com, the CEO of Walmart U.S. e-commerce, and now, as a part owner of NBA/WNBA teams, along with Telosa, a city that he’s announced he’s building from scratch. One thing he’s learned from all of these audacious endeavors: you can’t leap alone. You need to convince your team, and more importantly, your customers to leap with you. As you’ll hear in this episode, Lore’s many leaps have evolved the way he assesses the risk involved.

Obama talks about how being in the right place, at the right time, with the right mindset enabled his political ascension. Fueled by what President Obama calls “preparation and perspiration,” his 2008 campaign was a startup that defied expectations. Then came the big pivot: figuring out how to move from renegade mode to leading one of the world's largest enterprises, the U.S. government.

        <![CDATA[<p>When Paul Polman joined Unilever as CEO in 2009, the consumer goods company – home to 400-plus brands including Dove soap, Ben &amp; Jerry’s, and Vaseline – had been stagnated with years of lackluster performance. His famous turnaround of the company centered around his ability to redraw the boundaries of Unilever’s mission to emphasize sustainability and long-term growth. He’s a perfect example of why every leader should consistently reexamine the boundaries that limit their business – and be prepared to redraw them as you grow. By redrawing boundaries, you can reinvigorate your team with a new sense of power.

The email marketing platform was acquired this year by Intuit in a multi-billion-dollar deal that closed this month.

The Mailchimp story is the exception to Reid's rule (always raise more money than you think you need!). The episode explores a range of options for those who don't fit the VC-funding mold.

      <title>Rapid Response: The truth about what we watch, with Nielsen’s David Kenny</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>How do you respond when your own users resist your data? That question is top-of-mind for Nielsen CEO David Kenny. For decades, Nielsen has measured ratings and demographics across TV and media – the ultimate designator of success and failure.

      <title>Rapid Response: Launching a $500b startup, w/Jet.com's Marc Lore</title>

And then last month, he outlined his plans to build a new American city called Telosa, centered around sustainability and inclusion. Lore, who co-founded Jet.com, an e-commerce company that sold to Walmart in 2016, says that he approaches these moonshot ideas in the same manner: by reverting to the fundamentals and naming the mission and values.

      <title>Rapid Response: How to lead for enduring impact w/ Spelman’s Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Your ability to make quick decisions in the face of a crisis can define your career. That’s been the case for Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, president of Spelman College, the all-women's HBCU in Atlanta. In her second appearance on Rapid Response, Dr. Campbell, who recently announced her plan to retire at the end of the academic year, discusses how listening to her community has led to resolving complex conflicts. As was the case at the beginning of the school year when the Spelman faculty threatened a last-minute boycott over COVID uncertainty – a potential crisis which Dr. Campbell was able to quickly defuse. From record fundraising to rising U.S. News ratings for Spelman, Dr. Campbell demonstrates how consistent leadership builds confidence and resilience. “I feel that when we have all of the voices and all of the wisdom from all over our campus involved in these big issues,” Dr. Campbell says, “the solutions are ones that end up being good for everybody.”</p><p>Read a transcript of this interview at:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Rapid Response: When to build the company before the product, with Aurora CEO Chris Urmson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Chris Urmson has had to take a different approach in building his company Aurora, which develops self-driving technology. As opposed to creating and iterating a product with a handful of people, and then building a company around that product, Urmson says he’s had to do the opposite. “Given the scale of the problem we're trying to solve and the complexity and breadth of it, we really had to build the company almost ahead of the product,” he says in this interview with Rapid Response host and editor-at-large Bob Safian. Urmson is determined to transform transportation as it is today – a goal that has and will continue to require a great amount of energy and investment upfront, he says.

      <title>Rapid Response: When you should require vaccinations w/ Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>“You have to preserve your energy because this year has been about pace,” says iconic restaurateur Danny Meyer in his fourth Rapid Response interview. Meyer catches us up on the past seven-plus months of operating in the midst of the pandemic. In the beginning of the summer, when Covid rates were plummeting in New York City, he says he was full of optimism. His restaurants were back to indoor dining, and despite dealing with a limited workforce, “progress is progress.” Then came the Delta variant, leading Meyer to proactively require Covid-19 vaccinations for all staff and guests at his full service restaurants. All of this while overseeing the opening of two new Daily Provision locations and a full-service restaurant in New York City, called Ci Siamo, the three of which had been in development for three years. Meyer also walks us through his February launch of HUGS, a new SPAC that’s led him down a journey of meeting with a wide variety of businesses that share the notion of what he calls enlightened hospitality.

        <![CDATA[<p>Even an 118-year-old company needs an entrepreneurial jolt. When Jochen Zeitz took over as CEO of motorcycle maker Harley Davidson in early 2020, he moved quickly to restructure the business – even in the midst of the pandemic's highest uncertainty. That defiance paid off, settling investors and refocusing the company. He's trimmed the product line, set up equity grants for employees including factory workers, and doubled-down on Harley’s brand power. Challenges persist, including ongoing supply chain delays, but Zeitz has his eyes on the road ahead. As a longtime motorcycle rider and a longtime champion of sustainability, he is setting out to square those two passions – and lead the company through an expansive second century.</p><p>Read a transcript of this interview at:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Unconventional ideas define entrepreneurship: They fuel dreams but also spur naysayers and obstacles. Katia Beauchamp, co-founder and CEO of Birchbox, has repeatedly found ways to recast the unconventional as something obvious, enabling ongoing growth through repeated challenges.

Then, as it caught on, competitors from Amazon to Sephora took direct aim by copying Birchbox's approach – and crushing margins in the process.

        <![CDATA[<p>"Corporations can be a force for good – and they can also be very successful," says Ken Chenault, chair of investment firm General Catalyst and former longtime CEO of American Express. During the past year, Ken has been an outspoken advocate for business leaders to actively engage in societal matters. After George Floyd’s death, he and Merck CEO Ken Frazier launched OneTen, a coalition to create 1 million jobs for Black Americans that now includes major brands from IBM to Nike to Walmart. Chenault has pushed corporate chiefs to use their leverage to protect voting rights, and he's come out with a platform for Responsible Innovation that puts what he calls “social due diligence” alongside financial due diligence.

      <title>Rapid Response: Surviving a close shave, with Harry's co-CEO  Andy Katz-Mayfield</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Harry's took a one-two punch in 2020 – right on the chin.

We're talking with Linda Findley Kozlowski, CEO of meal-kit pioneer Blue Apron, because she’s on the frontlines of assessing which pandemic-fueled behaviors will persist, and in what ways. Early on, Linda made the choice NOT to sop up every ounce of demand, instead focusing on what she calls sustainable growth.

      <itunes:summary>With the pandemic, cooking at home got a renewed boost, and meal kit outfits saw a rise in demand. But a year in, the trend toward at-home dining now faces a new inflection point. We're talking with Linda Findley Kozlowski, CEO of meal-kit pioneer Blue Apron, because she’s on the frontlines of assessing which pandemic-fueled behaviors will persist, and in what ways. Early on, Linda made the choice NOT to sop up every ounce of demand, instead focusing on what she calls sustainable growth. Blue Apron has seen a flood of new competitors come onto the market, but her bet is that long-term trends and a differentiated product will matter more than crisis opportunity. As she puts it, a pandemic is not a business model.

      <title>78. Tyra Banks: Personal brand power</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>To succeed in the modern business environment, you need to strut your stuff: to cultivate a personal brand that supports career growth. No one represents this better than Tyra Banks. As a model, a producer, and an entrepreneur, Tyra has forged a personal brand that has enabled her to make multiple pivots, building fame, wealth, and meaningful impact on the issues that matter most to her. Startups can come and go, and so can employers. In our very uncertain landscape, the thing that remains constant is YOU: how you solve problems, how you learn from mistakes, how you build networks and relationships. And what you stand for. At its core a personal brand is a promise to a solution – and everyone, from your customers to your investors to your extended network, will want a clear and compelling picture of who you are and what you bring to the table.

      <title>Rapid Response: A prescription for healthy growth, with FIGS Co-CEO Heather Hasson</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>How does a start-up geared to healthcare workers balance giving back during Covid with the desire for growth? FIGS, an emerging lifestyle brand for medical professionals that built its name around premium scrubs, faced key choices amid the pandemic. Co-founder and co-CEO Heather Hasson explains why a commitment to offering free PPE, isolation gowns, and more supported both FIGS's mission and its community. Shifting supply lines, leaning into a robust e-commerce system, and expanding internationally in response to demand, the FIGS team used the moment to reinforce their relationship with their customers – and saw annual revenue climb past $250 million.

      <title>76. Virgin’s Sir Richard Branson: The secret to big leaps</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Successful daredevils aren't really winging it, even if it looks that way from the outside. They have a method. No one knows this better – or does this better – than Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group. Sir Richard has been willing to take death-defying entrepreneurial leaps again and again, into new markets and industries, establishing himself as one of the most prolific and successful founders ever. You can't help but marvel at his bias to action: his eagerness to ask “What if?” and then follow up those fanciful thoughts with bold and decisive steps forward. You don't have to be born with Sir Richard’s bravado to cultivate a bias to action. Sir Richard shares how you too can learn to take the right leaps, in the right moments, to generate outsize opportunities.</p><p>Read a transcript of this episode at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

Rana el Kaliouby, co-founder and CEO of Affectiva, has spent most of her career thinking about how to project – and steward – the possible uses of artificial intelligence.

        <![CDATA[<p>The biggest challenge for founders often isn’t winning the strategic game – it’s winning the mental game. For a master class in mastering your emotions, we turn to Sam Harris, author, neuroscientist, and philosopher. His podcast “Making Sense,” his app “Waking Up,” and his many books have drawn a devoted following among entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and beyond. Leadership experts often talk about the importance of adding new skills to your metaphorical toolbox, but less attention is paid to the actual toolbox itself: your mind. Sam shares how you can manage your own emotions, and master your own runaway thoughts, to not only make it through the entrepreneurial journey but learn more, and scale faster along the way.</p><p>Read a transcript of this episode at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Google has succeeded by innovating again and again. Their secret? They don’t tell their employees how to innovate; they manage the chaos.

      <title>Rapid Response: What the pandemic has cost women, w/Ellevest's Sallie Krawcheck</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Amidst the devastating effects of the pandemic, one in five women has left the workforce, and the gender pay gap and wealth gap are expanding. There's a long-term cost to that inequity, says Sallie Krawcheck, co-founder and CEO of Ellevest, a fintech platform dedicated to serving women investors – and businesses can help to address that cost. A long-time C-suite leader at financial behemoths like Citi and Bank of America, Krawcheck knows firsthand the obstacles women face as well as the struggles big institutions can have in reconfiguring their practices to help.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>If 2021 is even half as unpredictable as 2020 was, you'll need to dig deep into your resilience and wisdom to get through.

These lessons come from a range of guests we've spoken to in a time of incredible change. Some are stories about doing everything right – and still ending up in crisis. Others are about overcoming the odds with grit, heart, and compassion.

        <![CDATA[<p>Onboarding isn't just about employees. The often overlooked step-by-step process – to join a product or company – lays the foundation for everything that follows. No one knows this better than Melanie Perkins, co-founder and CEO of Canva. From the moment she started the Australia-based graphic design platform, she knew she had to engage newcomers with simplicity and speed. It took a series of steps: onboard users to her product, one-by-one; onboard investors to help her build; onboard employees in a way that would pass along her values and her vision. Then onboard new investors, new features, new partners, new markets with the same care and ease-of-use – but at scale.

      <title>Rapid Response: Loneliness at work, w/Noreena Hertz</title>

Even before the pandemic forced us to stay home, loneliness was snaking its way through our lives, affecting everything from how we vote to how we work. Professor at University College London and author of the upcoming book, The Lonely Century, Noreena has some sage advice for businesses: about how less loneliness fuels more productivity, the bottom-line advantages of in-person connection over virtual interactions, and why values like kindness, community, and care are key to attracting and retaining talent.

        <![CDATA[<p>After record-shattering drops in revenue from Covid-19, JetBlue had to rethink every plan and every assumption. Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue's president and chief operating officer, shares how the airline built a new system for flexing the business, to ramp up only when demand rises, deploying cost cuts but no furloughs. As airlines grapple with a new global infection surge, Geraghty says her decisions rely on new types of data as well as gut feeling – from re-opening middle seats starting in January 2021 to expanding flights to London. The volume of choices Geraghty has to make and the uncertainty around the risks are dizzying.

As airlines grapple with a new global infection surge, Geraghty says her decisions rely on new types of data as well as gut feeling – from re-opening middle seats starting in January 2021 to expanding flights to London. The volume of choices Geraghty has to make and the uncertainty around the risks are dizzying. But despite the challenges, she says, JetBlue is rising up.

They focused on one thing: making an excellent product for people who believed in the edgy Nike ethos.

Dr. Bon Ku, an ER physician at Jefferson University Hospital and director of the Health Design Lab, returns to the podcast to share what he’s seeing as we enter a new season and how we might respond. His proposals for health care delivery – about both heightened vigilance and creative shifts to financing, supply chains, digital tools, etc. – provide a bracing wake-up call.

      <title>69. The Empathy Flywheel, w/Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A social network that limits your network? Yes. Meet Nextdoor, a hyperlocal social network that’s all about who you really are and where you really live.

      <title>Rapid Response: The Covid test facts every CEO needs, w/Rajiv Shah (Rockefeller Foundation)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>To safely re-open a business, you need more than masks. Covid testing is key – and the options are changing quickly. We found the most in-the-know person in public health to walk us through the choices, costs, and protocols to keep an entrepreneurial team, and all of us, safe. Rajiv Shah is president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which has led response to health crises in the United States and around the world for 100 years (including the 1918 flu pandemic). Applying what he learned fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Shah has brought together business, government, and health officials to turbo-charge Covid testing development. Next-gen test kits are coming soon: cheaper, easier, more abundant.

      <title>66. How to build authentic connection at scale, w/Trevor McFedries &amp; Lil Miquela</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>You might not know Trevor McFedries yet, but if you're on Instagram, you've probably met Miquela. She has millions of followers, hit singles and lucrative contracts with brands. But she’s not actually real. Miquela’s the creation of Trevor’s stealthy creative media studio Brud, and the delicate balance they strike between artificial and authentic is a master class for any scaling company. In this first-ever in-depth interview with Trevor, he shares his bold plan to create celebrity at massive, multilingual scale; his advice for entrepreneurs of color as they fundraise; and his guidance for anyone connecting at scale: That once you build that connection with your audience, they don't care HOW you made it. All they care about is how it makes them feel.

Though Eva runs charter schools, any leader or entrepreneur can learn from her experience: how and when to make decisions in an uncertain environment, how and why to communicate with constituents, why to celebrate remote work – and who we should all prioritize.</p><p>Read a transcript of this episode at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>65. Peloton’s John Foley – How to turn skeptics into fans</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Casual fans come and go. But converts stick with you – and spread the word. The trick is knowing how – and WHEN – to convert skeptics into super-fans. No one knows this better than Peloton co-founder and CEO John Foley, who has one of the most epic “No-to-Yes” stories in startup history. When he founded the company in 2012, skeptics abounded – especially among investors. But John pushed forward, convincing co-founders, angel investors, and then riders, one at a time. As he converted those skeptical customers – in their flagship fitness studio, in their stores, and on their at-home bikes – the feedback loops kicked in. After pedaling in place for years, Peloton rocketed up the hill to its 2019 IPO.

      <title>64. Why your company needs new rituals w/Shishir Mehrotra (YouTube, Coda) </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>You need more than a good product to scale – you need strong rituals. All companies have rituals, from holding all-hands meetings to measuring KPIs. The right rituals in the right places help build your culture, cohere your team, and home in on your targets. The wrong ones can lead you horribly astray. Shishir Mehrotra, former head of YouTube and co-founder of Coda, learned this when he scaled YouTube to a billion hours of watch time each day. He kept the team focused on that audacious goal by establishing fresh new rituals. And in his new role as CEO and founder of Coda, he's learned to constantly ask: What old rituals are holding us back?

This is the question for Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, president of Spelman College.

Meanwhile, as the head of a leading HBCU, based in the protest hotbed of Atlanta, she's also been grappling with social unrest and calls for change.

PayPal has boomed as e-commerce has swelled, with stock up more than 50% this year and a huge new demographic joining the platform.

PayPal recently committed more than $500 million to support Black and minority-owned businesses, after facilitating some $1.9 billion in PPP loans to largely underbanked communities.

      <title>Rapid Response: What it will take for tech and Hollywood to be anti-racist, w/Color Of Change's Rashad Robinson </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>There's no quick fix to 400 years of oppression, says Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson. One of the largest racial justice organizations in the US, Color Of Change works with decision-makers in business and government to enact systemic change. In 2020, Color Of Change has seen its membership swell — along with its impact. Rashad's group railed against Hollywood's reflexive pro-police agenda, forcing TV shows "Cops" and "Live PD" off the air, and launched the Stop Hate For Profit campaign to hold tech companies accountable for what happens on social platforms. By working together, says Rashad, we can make a lasting difference.

      <title>62. The 4 core principles of crisis management, w/Ellen Kullman (DuPont, Carbon)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>To survive a crisis, you have to double down on who you already are as a company. This is something Ellen Kullman knows, having led DuPont through the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and taken the CEO role at 3D-printing unicorn Carbon only weeks before Covid hit. Through her years as a leader, Ellen has developed four crisis principles that allowed her to lead teams and thrive through pandemic, economic meltdown, and beyond. The key? Practicing the principles in calmer times, before crisis hits. Because as Reid says: there's no such thing as a crisis playbook. There's just your playbook. Cameos: Amy Shira Teitel (spaceflight historian), Jonah Peretti (BuzzFeed), Brian Chesky (Airbnb), Neil Blumenthal (Warby Parker), Stacy Brown-Philpot (TaskRabbit).</p><p>Read a transcript of this episode at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

With the pandemic, economic crisis, and civil unrest all coming together after George Floyd's death, Walker found himself flooded with calls from CEOs struggling for how to respond. Walker's advice mixes clear-eyed messages — denying the trauma borne by communities of color is no longer option — with optimism about the opportunities ahead. At the Ford Foundation, they've accelerated giving and even exceeded their own KPIs.

      <title>Rapid Response: Burning cash, accepting turbulence w/Delta CEO Ed Bastian</title>
      <description>

        <![CDATA[<p>Forget writing that business plan. Design an experiment instead. So many products and companies fail because the assumptions in their beautiful business plans were just wrong.

      <title>Rapid Response: GM's Mary Barra: "Going ventilator fast"</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>GM is now reopening auto plants, after shutting them in March, temporarily reducing pay for 69,000 employees, and making a fast pivot to produce masks and ventilators. But with the killing of George Floyd, things are hardly back to normal.

      <title>Rapid Response: Danny Meyer, 10 weeks later: How to revive restaurants  </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>"Being the first to close is one thing. But I don't want to be the last to open,” says iconic restaurateur Danny Meyer in his second Rapid Response interview. After shutting his iconic New York City restaurants, laying off 2,000 staffers (with hopes to re-hire) and returning a $10m PPP, Danny finds himself reconsidering nearly everything about his business model. Even before the coronavirus lockdown, the restaurant industry had a slew of “preexisting conditions,” Danny says. Now those weaknesses have become exposed, putting at risk the future of hospitality — one of America’s core industries. Danny’s Union Square Hospitality Group is reimagining what and HOW their restaurants serve; rethinking how they generate revenue; and exploring new cost structures, like a bold new relationship with landlords. It’s all in the hopes, says Danny, of getting back to business, with customers safely at their tables, and the teams back together.

      <title>Rapid Response: How Warby Parker is making decisions in uncertainty, with CEO Neil Blumenthal</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>"It's like getting hit in the face over and over and over,” says Warby Parker co-CEO Neil Blumenthal. But “crisis brings out clarity.” At Warby, planning for the future has meant leaning into the present — from physical changes in their factory and stores that ensure social distancing to optimizing online vision tests. Blumenthal shares the complex factors they consider in deciding which stores to re-open and when, and relates the human challenge of inspiring their on-the-ground factory employees — at times of increased risk. For Blumenthal, it's all about recognizing new priorities (safety) and fitting them into ongoing strategy.&nbsp;Interviewed by editor Bob Safian.</p><p>Read a transcript of this episode at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter at&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Rapid Response: Future-proofing Verizon, with CEO Hans Vestberg </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Data streaming, videoconferencing – even phone calls are way up at Verizon amid Covid-19, as digital interaction steps in for IRL. But boom times don't mean easy times for CEO Hans Vestberg, who moved over 100,000 employees remote in two weeks. As coronavirus hit and pressure on the Verizon network skyrocketed, Vestberg split his leadership team in two: one to deal with the specifics of the crisis and one to focus on pursuing present-and-future business goals. From new customer initiatives (like free bandwidth and FIOS-in-a-box) to future bets (like the acquisition of video conferencing service BlueJeans), Vestberg has championed that meeting customers' needs today – even if not fully compensated for them – will pay off for the business tomorrow.

      <title>Rapid Response: Target’s Brian Cornell: “I want to see retail survive this” </title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Every day in a pandemic is different, and that’s true for people and for corporations. CEO Brian Cornell has promised Target will keep its doors open. To do that, Target is becoming "a good student," says Brian, listening to experts, collaborating with CEOs, staying flexible, and meeting daily to make decisions on an ever changing list of priorities, the first of which is to keep both the team and the guests safe. To date, they’ve made a $300 million investment in pay and benefits, back up childcare, elder care, enhanced store cleanings, and more. No one knows what will happen, says Brian, but he believes that by putting his team first, he is putting the customer first – and serving the larger community.&nbsp;Interviewed by editor Bob Safian.</p><p>Read a transcript of this episode:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Rapid Response: A playbook for when "there’s no playbook," w/CEO Ellen Kullman (Carbon, DuPont)</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>How do you survive a crisis? You create your own trajectory, says Ellen Kullman.

During those years of straight free fall, Ellen learned how to lead through what seemed like completely devastating circumstances and developed four crisis principles, forged through the fire of experience. She’s putting those to the test now, at the helm of 3D printing unicorn startup, Carbon. She took the role just five months ago — and then headed straight into the pandemic. At Carbon, she’s zeroing in on what she can control (from innovating manufacturing to restructuring supply chains to where the team works) and pivoting to create a new path to success.</p><p>Read a transcript of this episode:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Rapid Response: Airbnb’s Brian Chesky: "Crisis is pushing us back to our roots"</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>As the pandemic hit, Airbnb was preparing for an IPO. Within a matter of days, everything changed dramatically, as travel worldwide screamed to a halt. “I felt like I was captain of a ship and a torpedo hit the side,” says CEO Brian Chesky. Airbnb responded quickly, announcing that they'd override host rules and allow for guest cancellations. They went on to establish a relief fund for hosts, lobby the U.S. Congress to include hosts in the CARES stimulus package; open up a new business line of virtual experiences, and raise an astounding one billion dollars in new capital — all with the goal of both weathering the storm and laying the groundwork for the new era of travel that Chesky firmly believes will follow.

      <title>56. How to start a revolution, w/Bitcoin pioneer Wences Casares (Xapo)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>What if your idea is so radical that people have trouble grasping what it is — or even believing it won't harm them? Every founder believes their product is revolutionary – and the more revolutionary their product, the more reassuring they’ll need to be to get consumers on board.

      <title>50. LIVE! Find your Trojan horse, w/Robert F. Smith</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Recorded live at Summit LA: Every great founder has a second purpose — something outside their main business they're trying to get done in the world. And every successful company is like a Trojan horse, carrying this second purpose forward. No one knows this better than Robert F. Smith. You may know him for his legendary Morehouse commencement speech (in which he promised to pay off the student loan debt of the entire graduating class), but Robert's scaling success and philanthropic work go far beyond that. As founder, chairman and CEO of private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, Robert finds profound ways to serve both his business and his second purpose — liberating people to reach their true potential — at scale.

      <title>47. Bill Gates: How to accelerate history (Part 1)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>How did Bill Gates scale BOTH a global business and a global philanthropy? He spotted an inflection point in history — and accelerated it. What does that take? A great idea, great timing and also: Great partners. Because even Bill Gates doesn’t go it alone. In Part 1 of this special two-part episode, Bill reflects with Reid on the founding and growth of Microsoft — how he not only spotted an inflection point (hello, personal computers) but accelerated it to massive scale (forget computers, let's talk platforms). There’s timeless wisdom in Bill’s ability to identify inflection points, build strategic partnerships and just work harder than everyone else. (In <a href="https://mastersofscale.com/bill-gates-biggest-success-story-you-havent-heard/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, Bill reflects on scaling the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the different lessons learned between the two.)</p><p>Read a transcript of this interview at: <a href="https://mastersofscale.com/bill-gates-how-to-accelerate-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/bill-gates-how-to-accelerate-history/</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

As the new CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi took on the most extreme pirate-to-navy transition in startup history. Though Uber blitzscaled to become the most valuable startup in the world, it was also notorious for its toxic culture. Dara turned the company around. His method? Truth-telling and doing the right thing. Cameo appearances: Arianna Huffington (Thrive Global) and Ben Chestnut (Mailchimp).</p><p>Read a transcript of this interview at:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/dara-khosrowshahi-how-pirates-become-the-navy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/dara-khosrowshahi-how-pirates-become-the-navy/</a></p><p>Subscribe to the Masters of Scale weekly newsletter:&nbsp;<a href="https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://mastersofscale.com/subscribe</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>26. Instagram's Kevin Systrom: Keep it simple while scaling big </title>
      <description>

After stints at two successful startups, he launched out on his own with Walker &amp;amp; Company, makers of the Bevel razor — and learned to navigate the world of investors who may or may not share your vision.

Mariam Naficy shares her white-knuckle experiences founding startups that survived two financial crashes — the online cosmetic company Eve.com in the dotcom-boom ’90s, and founder and the design marketplace Minted.com today.
