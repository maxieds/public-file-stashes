      <title>Ukrainian counteroffensive; the coup in Niger; American’s recession mystery; the wonders of quantum computing</title>
      <description>President Zelensky admitted this week that Ukraine’s counteroffensive has been “difficult” and Fareed talks with Alina Polyakova, the President and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis, about why it hasn't yielded the results many expected. Then, the recent coup in Niger: Fareed speaks with the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Africa Center, Rama Yade, about what this will mean for a region already plagued by unrest. Fareed then asks Jason Furman, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, a question on many people's minds: how did the US avoid a recession? Plus, theoretical physicist Michio Kaku tells Fareed why he believes the next big technological revolution is not artificial intelligence, but quantum computing.
Guests: Alina Polyakova (@apolyakova), Rama Yade (@ramayade), Jason Furman (@jasonfurman), Michio Kaku (@michiokaku), Bruce Feiler (@BruceFeiler).

      <title>Three former Treasury Secretaries on the global economic outlook; An interview with David Byrne</title>
      <description>This week on the show, Fareed sits down with three former Treasury Secretaries to discuss the state of the world economy. 
First, he hosts Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner to talk about the US debt downgrade and the chances of a recession in the near future. They also discuss the Biden administration's China policy and whether there's a path to a stable relationship with Beijing. 
Then, President Clinton’s Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin talks to Fareed about decision-making – and how a yellow legal pad can help us all weigh the risks and rewards. 
Plus, a special interview with iconic artist David Byrne who talks with Fareed about his latest Broadway musical. “Here Lies Love” tells the tale former First Lady of the Philippines Imelda Marcos … and her love of disco.

      <description>Jeh Johnson, the former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, joins the show this week to talk about the migration crisis as American authorities lose an important tool to keep order at the U.S./Mexico border. Then, The Economist’s Mian Ridge explains Britain's highly controversial immigration bill which would ban migrants arriving via boat. Hear why she believes it is not the right solution. Fareed also speaks with Martin Wolf, Chief Economics Commentator for The Financial Times, in the leadup to America’s debt ceiling deadline. How does this circus look from abroad? And how would a default impact the international financial system? Plus, Fawaz Gerges, Professor of International Relations at The London School of Economics, talks to Fareed about the Arab League's decision this week to welcome Syria back into the organization…and what he thinks a post-American Middle East might look like.

      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/biden-meets-xi-jinping-and-the-world-reacts-to-ame</link>
      <description>Guest anchor Bianna Golodryga talks to Ian Bremmer, Eurasia Group president, and Anne Applebaum, staff writer for The Atlantic, about Biden's first in-person meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and what it means for the world's two largest economies, plus how the world views the U.S. midterm results. Then, Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, discusses Russia’s withdrawal from the Ukrainian city of Kherson. How significant is this Ukrainian victory? And after Benjamin Netanyahu received the mandate to try and build the next coalition government in Israel, Anshel Pfeffer, a Jerusalem-based writer for Haaretz and The Economist, examines the likely result: will it end up being Israel’s most right-wing government ever? Plus, Bill Weir, CNN’s Chief Climate Correspondent, on what was (and wasn’t) accomplished at the UN’s climate conference.

      <description>Boris Bondarev, a former Russian diplomat who resigned in protest of the war in Ukraine, tells Fareed about why the Kremlin is making bad decisions. Will Putin decide to use nukes next? Then, Fareed sits down with Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor in chief of The Economist, to discuss whether Britain’s new PM Rishi Sunak is ready to rescue the UK. Then, after the U.S. received a poor report card on educating its children, Fareed asks Sal Khan, CEO of Khan Academy, how to fix America’s broken education system.

And, as protests for revolution in Iran continue, Fareed speaks to Iranian-American writer Roya Hakakian about how she says it feels like Iran’s 1979 revolution all over again and could have the same effect – the toppling of a government. Then, after OPEC+ announced it was slashing oil production, Fareed talks to Amrita Sen, founder and director of research at Energy Aspects, about the decision – one that was a present to Putin and a rebuff to Biden. Plus, when Fareed was in Ukraine he sat down with Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office and Zelensky's right hand man, to ask what it's like to govern a country at war.

      <description>Finnish President Sauli Niinistö on why Vladimir Putin is not likely to accept defeat in Ukraine and why Europe will remain united against Russia, even if it means a very cold winter. Then, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol tells Fareed why North Korea is still an imminent threat to his nation and the world. Then, as protests in Iran erupt after the death of a woman who had been arrested by the country's morality police, Karim Sadjadpour, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, sits down with Fareed to discuss whether Iran’s theocracy can survive the unrest. Plus, a fascinating conversation at the Clinton Global Initiative about how to make the world a better place - with philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, chef José Andrés and Mia Mottley, the Prime Minister of Barbados.

      <description>After half a year of war in Ukraine, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby tells CNN's Jim Sciutto that Putin shows no signs of backing down, while renewed shelling of a Russian-occupied nuclear plant in Ukraine has the world on edge. And, will the Iran nuclear deal be revived? Jim asks former U.S. Energy Secretary and nuclear physicist, Ernest Moniz. Then, Fareed asks Janette Sadik-Khan, New York City’s former transportation commissioner, whether a future of car-less cities is possible. Plus, Economist writer Callum Williams, on how automation will change the future of jobs. Finally, as the 25th anniversary of the death of princess Diana approaches, author Tina Brown joins Fareed to talk about her new book, "The Palace Papers: Inside the House of Windsor—the Truth and the Turmoil."

      <title>Ukraine's counteroffensive, China's economic meltdown and the future of the Iran Nuclear Deal</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/ukraines-counteroffensive-chinas-economic-meltdown</link>
      <description>Retired US Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling assesses Ukraine's counteroffensive strategy against Russia. David Rennie, The Economist's Bejing Bureau Chief, discusses China's slow growing economy and whether it poses any risk to Xi Jinping. Then, will Iran accept a revived nuclear deal? Dina Esfandiary of the International Crisis Group and Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace offer their opinions. Plus, as some Americans ask whether its constitution needs a refresh, a look at a country that is trying to rewrite its own central document. Fareed talks to Andres Velasco, former Chilean finance minister and current London School of Economics public policy dean. And, space as you’ve never seen it before, a conversation with Mike Menzel, NASA’s lead mission systems engineer for the James Webb Space Telescope.

      <description>As the one-year anniversary of the chaotic Taliban takeover of Kabul approaches, Fareed has an exclusive interview with the former president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, about why he fled the country, if he feels betrayed by the U.S., and whether the rumors are true that he escaped with many tens of millions of dollars. Then, former U.S. Marine turned journalist and author Elliot Ackerman discusses his time fighting in Afghanistan and what America did right and wrong there.  And the show begins with Fareed’s Take on the lessons the U.S. can take from the war.

      <description>As China continues its military drills around Taiwan, Oriana Skylar Mastro, Fellow at Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute and a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, explains why this is not just a show of force by China, but an actual combat rehearsal. Then, Richard Haass, president of The Council on Foreign Relations, and Susan Shirk, Chair at UCSD's 21st Century China Center, join Fareed for a discussion on what's the best way to preserve peace in and around Taiwan and how to lower the tension in U.S.-China relations. Plus, CNN's national security analyst, Peter Bergen, on the American killing of Al Qaeda's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and what it means for the global state of terrorism.

      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/will-speaker-pelosi-go-to-taiwan-if-she-does-how-w</link>
      <description>As Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi departs for her trip to Asia, Fareed asks Adm. Mike Mullen (Ret.), former Joint Chiefs Chairman, if she will visit Taiwan and how China might react. Pivoting to the war in Ukraine, Fareed asks Mullen if Kyiv can be successful in its attempts to take back territory from Russia. Plus, an inside look at one of the most influential companies you've probably never heard of: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Fareed sits down with its chairman, Mark Liu, to talk technology, politics in the region and why war with China would be a lose-lose-lose situation.

      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/climate-change-inflation-and-ukraine-s-worried-nei</link>
      <description>As parts of Europe and the U.S. experience record heat, Fareed talks to the Chief Heat Officer of Athens, Greece, about how to adapt to climate change - now that it’s here.  Then, should President Biden declare a climate emergency, what are his powers to deal with climate change? Michigan Law professor Leah Litman tells Fareed. And, as inflation hits a forty-year high, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers talks to Fareed about whether we’re headed into a recession. Plus, the Prime Minister of Moldova Natalia Gavrilita on her country’s fears that President Putin may target them next.

      <description>After the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Fareed looks at the legal and political implications and how US abortion rights compare to other countries around the world. He talks with Emily Bazelon of The New York Times Magazine and Margot Sanger-Katz who covers health for The New York Times. Then, as G7 leaders gather in Germany, can they keep the pressure on Russia? And what does the collapse of Israel’s governing coalition mean for the country and the Middle East? Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass and Financial Times Chief Foreign Affairs Columnist Gideon Rachman join Fareed for a panel discussion. Plus: In France’s legislative elections last Sunday, both the far left and far right made gains. Who are the voters embracing these extremes? Fareed asks The Economist’s Paris bureau chief, Sophie Pedder.Guests: Emily Bazelon (@emilybazelon), Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) , Gideon Rachman (@gideonrachman), Richard Haass, (@RichardHaass), Sophie Pedder (@PedderSophie)

Plus, Shannon O'Neil, a vice president and senior fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, comments on recent elections in Latin America and whether there is a populist wave from the left.

      <title>Did NATO Expansion Prompt the War in Ukraine?; The Roots of the Racist Theory Behind the Buffalo Shooting</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/did-nato-expansion-prompt-the-war-in-ukraine-the-r</link>
      <description>Fareed is joined by former Polish Foreign and National Defense Minister Radosław Sikorski and Charles Kupchan, who served as senior director for European affairs in President Barack Obama’s National Security Council, to discuss if NATO enlargement prompted Putin to invade Ukraine and whether further enlargement - namely Finland and Sweden - will enflame him further. Then, the mass shooting in Buffalo, NY, has called attention to the racist and false “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Fareed talks to The Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor and American University extremism expert Cynthia Miller-Idriss about the roots behind the hateful theory and how it is spreading around the world.

Then, the mass shooting in Buffalo, NY, has called attention to the racist and false “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Fareed talks to The Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor and American University extremism expert Cynthia Miller-Idriss about the roots behind the hateful theory and how it is spreading around the world.  </p>

      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/december-5-2021-on-gps-global-vaccine-inequality-w</link>
      <description>Fareed welcomes South African human rights lawyer and the founder of the Health Justice Initiative in South Africa, Fatima Hassan, to discuss travel bans and the unequal distribution of vaccines around the world. Then, will the vaccines hold up against the Omicron variant? Fareed asks Moderna’s founder and chairman, Noubar Afeyan. Also, with tensions on the Russia-Ukarine border increasing, Fareed talks to former NATO Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis about the upcoming Biden-Putin call and the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Then, after this round of Iran nuclear deal talks ended poorly Friday in Vienna, Vali Nasr, professor at John’s Hopkins University and former senior adviser at the U.S. State Department, tells Fareed why Iran is hesitant to continue negotiations and why the U.S. needs a deal to stabilize the Middle East. Plus, how did the Taliban retake Afghanistan quickly and relatively peacefully? Margherita Stancati, a reporter at the Wall Street Journal, reveals their spy tactics and hidden networks.

      <title>November 14, 2021 | On GPS: Why is inflation rising?; America’s trucker shortage; U.S. reacts to Russian military escalations near Ukraine; and, the crisis at the Belarus-Poland Border</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/november-14-2021-on-gps-why-is-inflation-rising-am</link>
      <description>As U.S. inflation rises at the fastest pace in over 30 years, Fareed asks former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers why it is happening and how it can be stopped. 

Then, as supply chain problems persist, Fareed asks New York Times correspondent Ana Swanson about America's puzzling shortage of truckers. 

And earlier this week the U.S. warned Russia not to make a “serious mistake” by rehashing its 2014 invasion of Ukraine. Fareed asks former National Security Council official Fiona Hill if another invasion is possible. 

Plus, a voice from the world’s hottest continent. Vanessa Nakate talks to Fareed about why Africa should be front of mind in the climate discussion. 

Finally, has Belarus manufactured a heartbreaking migration crisis for political revenge? Fareed explains.

      <title>October 24, 2021 | On GPS: Would the U.S. really protect Taiwan against a Chinese attack?; China’s reported test of a hypersonic missile; the life and legacy of Angela Merkel; the new normal in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/october-24-2021-on-gps-would-the-u-s-really-protec</link>
      <description>Would China and the U.S. go to war over Taiwan? Fareed talks to Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, and Oriana Skylar Mastro of The American Enterprise Institute about the complex relationship the U.S. must navigate between China and Taiwan. Haass also reflects on the complicated legacy of his former boss at the State Department, the late Gen. Colin Powell. Then, David Sanger, national security correspondent for the New York Times, explains why China’s hypersonic missile testing is a significant step towards a potential twenty-first century arms race. As Germany bids auf wiedersehen to long-time Chancellor Angela Merkel, Kati Marton, journalist and author of the new book “The Chancellor,” tells Fareed about the qualities that made Merkel such a powerful chancellor and the legacy she leaves behind. Plus, Fareed checks in with Mahbouba Seraj, the founder of the Afghan Women’s Network. Seraj is still in Kabul and tells Fareed what life in the nation is like, 10 weeks after the Taliban took over. Lastly, Fareed looks at what some are calling “Striketober” — the rash of strikes and other labor problems around America - and why it actually might be a net positive for labor, business, and the American economy.

      <description>Haven’t received your online shopping on time? Fareed talks to David Lynch, global economics correspondent for the Washington Post, about why the post-pandemic economy is seeing supply shortages and high prices for goods. What is causing these glitches in the global supply chain? One piece of the puzzle is the shake-up in the labor market, Heather Long, an economics correspondent for the Washington Post, tells Fareed about the great re-assessment of work in America and how the puzzling data might foreshadow a positive future for productivity and growth in the global economy. Then, Anne Applebaum, staff writer for the Atlantic, explains Poland’s democratic downturn and why events in Poland may sound familiar to Americans. The Pandora Papers offered another glimpse at how and where the rich hide their wealth. Sarah Chayes, author of the book “On Corruption,” explains why South Dakota has become a global tax haven, right in the U.S. heartland. Plus, Fareed takes a look at the future of German politics as Angela Merkel departs from the spotlight after her 16-year tenure as Chancellor.

      <title>October 10, 2021 | On GPS: 2021 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Maria Ressa and her attorney Amal Clooney; Are China and Taiwan headed for war?; Is Britain just the beginning of a looming energy crisis?</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/october-10-2021-on-gps-2021-nobel-peace-prize-laur</link>
      <description>This week the Nobel Committee awarded Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov the Nobel peace prize for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression. Ressa and her attorney, international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, join Fareed to discuss why fighting for a free press is essential in maintaining healthy functional democracies around the world. Then: on Wednesday, Taiwan’s defense minister said that tensions with China are at their worst in 40 years, Fareed talks to former U.S. national security advisor Lt. General H.R. McMaster (Ret.) about the tense relationship between China and Taiwan and why the U.S. and its partners in the region need to aid Taiwan. As the northern hemisphere enters the winter months, the next energy crisis seems to be looming on the horizon. Tom Friedman, New York Times columnist, explains why there needs to be a global comprehensive energy plan that shifts to cleaner fuels. Plus, Fareed’s book “10 Lessons for a Post-Pandemic World” comes out in paperback with a new afterword where he reflects on one more important lesson that he learned during the latter part of the pandemic: how individuals need to build inner resources of mind and spirit.

      <description>Fareed talks to Joanne Lipman, former Editor-in-Chief of USA Today, on how the pandemic has made us rethink the workplace and our work-life balance. Then, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, tells Fareed how the transition to digital school came with a big learning curve for students, teachers, and parents alike and what can be done to improve the future of education. In the Spring of 2020, many thought cities would be yet another victim of the pandemic, but University of Toronto Professor Richard Florida says cities are here to stay – they just need to evolve. Lastly, Zanny Minton Beddoes, the editor-in-chief of The Economist, discusses the post-pandemic economy and what it will look like for people, for corporations and for nations.

      <description>Fareed offers his take on why leaving Afghanistan is still the right decision even amidst the heartbreaking and chaotic withdrawal. But, first, Jim Sciutto opens the show with Afghan natives Rina Amiri, Senior Fellow at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, and Sami Mahdi, an Afghan journalist, on the future of their home country. Reporting from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, CNN’s Senior International Correspondent Sam Kiley describes the ongoing troubles there. Then, Rory Stewart, former U.K. Secretary of State for International Development, and Andrey Kortunov, the Director General for the Russian International Affairs Council, join Jim for a discussion about how America’s allies and adversaries are reacting to the Afghanistan debacle. Also, former U.K. Foreign Secretary David Miliband explains to Jim how the Taliban takeover created not just a political-economic crisis but a humanitarian one as well.  Plus, a conversation with Laurie Santos, Professor of Psychology at Yale University and host of The Happiness Lab podcast, about how to train our brains to find happiness amidst these very challenging times.

      <description>As President Ghani flees Afghanistan while the Taliban seizes control of the country, Fareed talks to Clarissa Ward, CNN’s Chief International Correspondent, about the breathtaking speed of the Taliban’s takeover. Then, former Joint Chiefs Chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen (Ret.), talks about what happened to the Afghan Army.  Also, what will be the fate of women in Afghanistan? Mahbouba Seraj, a women’s rights activist in Kabul, tells Fareed how she will continue to fight for women’s rights in the country. Then, after weeks of back-to-back climate catastrophes around the world, John Kerry, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, calls for more effective global climate action. Plus, Greece’s Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, tells Fareed about the devastating fires that burned through his country and what the E.U., U.S., and the world need to do in order to ensure a climate-stable future.

      <title>June 27, 2021 |On GPS: As China celebrates a century of communism, Fareed talks to an expert panel about what’s next for China. Plus, Malcolm Gladwell is back with a revisionist history perspective on everything from autonomous cars to the Little Mermaid.</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/june-27-2021-on-gps-as-china-celebrates-a-century</link>
      <description>On Thursday, the Chinese Communist Party will celebrate its 100-year anniversary and Beijing is commemorating with festivities all over the country. Fareed hosts Elizabeth Economy, senior fellow for China studies at the Council for Foreign Relations, Rana Mitter, professor of modern China at Oxford, and Jiayang Fan, a staff writer for The New Yorker, to discuss how the Chinese Communist Party survived a tumultuous century and what the future looks like for China as its economic power grows and expands all over the world. Then, Fareed and Malcolm Gladwell talk about what’s on the best-selling author and podcaster’s mind: self-driving cars, war games, college rankings, and Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Finally, Fareed looks at a worrying global trend: governments cracking down on free speech in online spaces.

      <title>June 20, 2021 |On GPS: What did the first Biden-Putin summit look like to Russians?; What should we know about Iran’s new president: Ebrahim Raisi?; And an exclusive interview with a Taliban spokesman about Afghanistan after the U.S. leaves.</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/june-20-2021-on-gps-what-did-the-first-biden-putin</link>
      <description>President Biden and President Putin met for the first time this week in Geneva and Fareed asks Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, about the state of U.S.-Russian relations and how cyberattacks are impacting the relationship. A low turnout election in Iran has secured a presidential win for hardliner Ebrahim Raisi. Robin Wright, contributing writer at The New Yorker, and Vali Nasr, Professor at Johns Hopkins University, explain who Raisi is and what his presidency will mean for Iran. Then, an exclusive interview with Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen about the future of Afghanistan after American and allied troops pull out of the country. Plus, anthropologist-turned-journalist Gillian Tett on her new book “Anthro-Vision,” where she lays out how important rituals and symbols are to human culture and why it’s good to embrace a bit of culture shock. Lastly, Fareed explains why a carbon tax can be the first big step in the fight against climate change.

      <title>May 30, 2021 | On GPS: Is the Benjamin Netanyahu era in Israel coming to a close? Fareed talks to Tom Friedman; then a panel discussion on Belarus's "state sponsored hijacking" and Michael Lewis on the U.S.’s COVID-19 stumbles.</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/may-30-2021-on-gps-is-the-benjamin-netanyahu-era-i</link>
      <description>As Israeli politicians are in tasks to form a coalition that may oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Fareed talk to the New York Times’ Tom Friedman about what that would mean – for Israel, for Palestinians, and for the 2-state solution.  Then he speaks to The Atlantic's Anne Applebaum and Belarusian reporter Hanna Liubakova about Belarus's "state sponsored hijacking" &amp; subsequent arrest of dissident journalist Roman Protasevich. Then Michael Lewis dives into his new book "The Premonition," where he investigates why the world's wealthiest nation – the U.S. – bumbled its initial COVID-19 response so badly. And, lastly, Fareed looks at why the worldwide decline in birth rates could have potentially devastating consequences for rapidly aging populations.

      <title>April 25, 2021 | On GPS:  What should the West make of Putin's ominous warning not to cross Russia’s “red line”?; The word “genocide” gets tossed around a lot – what is the history &amp; true meaning of the word?</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/april-25-2021-on-gps-what-should-the-west-make-of</link>
      <description>Airdate April 18, 2021:  Fareed offers his Take on the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine pause and the damage it may have done.  Then, Vladimir Putin warned the West this week not to cross Russia’s “red line”.  What does that mean?  And what to make of the massive build-up of Russia troops on its border with Ukraine?  Fareed talks to Radek Sikorsky, the former Foreign Minister of Poland who has negotiated with Putin. Also: words matter.  On Saturday, President Biden declared the mass killings of Armenians in WWI a genocide, but what does that word mean? Fareed talks to expert Philippe Sands. And, after global leaders made pledges to cut emissions at a U.S.-convened climate summit this week, will developing nations follow suit? M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, weighs in. Plus, Covid's devastating comeback in India. The Guardian's Hannah Ellis-Petersen reports on the “COVID hell” that India is experiencing. And, finally, why nuclear power is the more sustainable option for the future of energy production.

      <description>Airdate April 18, 2021: After the Biden administration said this week it's pulling out of Afghanistan, Fareed has an exclusive interview with the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, on what the U.S. withdrawal means for his country and its citizens. Then, former Trump national security advisor Gen. H.R.

      <title>April 11, 2021 | On GPS: How to pay for Biden's big dollar plans; re-engaging with Iran; Turkey's illiberal democracy</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/april-11-2021-on-gps-how-to-pay-for-bidens-big-dol</link>
      <description>Airdate April 11, 2021: Trump slashed corporate tax rates in his tenure as president. Biden has taken haste to undo that, securing funding for his new American jobs plan. Fareed talks to Wally Adeyemo, U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. And, the Iran deal - can the U.S. and Iran resume talks? Should they? Fareed has a great debate with an all-star panel. Then, at another negotiating table, an awkward game of musical chairs in Turkey left one European leader without a seat. What this scene might say about Turkey's continuing slide away from the West…and away from democracy.

      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/april-4-2021-on-gps-bidens-big-bid-to-rebuild-amer</link>
      <description>Airdate April 4, 2021: Before hitting his 100-day mark, Pres. Biden has passed a $2T COVID relief bill and proposed a $2T infrastructure and jobs package. Some have already begun putting him in the pantheon with FDR &amp; LBJ.  Are those comparisons apt? Fareed asks historians, Jon Meacham and Niall Ferguson. Then, the WHO's latest report saw no evidence that COVID-19 originated in a lab. Fareed speaks to Peter Daszak, one of the scientists who carried out this controversial investigation in China. And Germany went from great success against COVID-19 to close to failure – now entering its third spike. What changed? Fareed speaks to the New York Time's Correspondent Melissa Eddy.

      <title>March 21, 2021 | On GPS: Top U.S. officials had wars of words this week with their Russian and Chinese counterparts.  What’s next for those already difficult relations?</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/march-21-2021-on-gps-top-u-s-officials-had-wars-of</link>
      <description>Airdate March 21, 2021: Fareed offers his Take on America’s already bloated defense budget and why the administration may use China to justify asking for even more money.  Then, he talks to an all-star panel about President Biden affirming he thinks Putin is a “killer” and the un-diplomatic start of Secretary of State Blinken’s talks with his Chinese counterpart.  Will Washington’s difficult relations with Moscow and Beijing get even more so?  Then, a global COVID mystery: why has the developing world suffered relatively so few deaths compared to the developed world?  And Fareed explains why the filibuster hasn’t been used to further democracy but instead to promote policies that discriminate...and why it has to be scrapped!

      <itunes:summary>Airdate March 21, 2021: Fareed offers his Take on America’s already bloated defense budget and why the administration may use China to justify asking for even more money.  Then, he talks to an all-star panel about President Biden affirming he thinks Putin is a “killer” and the un-diplomatic start of Secretary of State Blinken’s talks with his Chinese counterpart.  Will Washington’s difficult relations with Moscow and Beijing get even more so?  Then, a global COVID mystery: why has the developing world suffered relatively so few deaths compared to the developed world?  And Fareed explains why the filibuster hasn’t been used to further democracy but instead to promote policies that discriminate...and why it has to be scrapped!

      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/march-14-2021-on-gps-bidens-1-9-trillion-relief-pa</link>
      <description>Airdate March 14, 2021: Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was signed into law Friday. So, will the plan deliver on its promises? Paul Krugman and Larry Summers debate the bill's size and its long-term consequences. Then, what you need to know about the Quad after Biden’s meeting with leaders from India, Australia and Japan on Friday. The bloc of four nations seeks to counter China's growing influence while promoting a "free and open Indo-Pacific." Former State Department official Susan Thornton tells Fareed how the group could reshape geopolitics in the East. And the biotech revolution brought about innovative solutions to the Covid-19 crisis. How will it change the world next? Walter Isaacson tells Fareed.

The former President's critics say it is further evidence that America's democracy is broken. So, what can be done to put it back together and make it stronger? David Frum and Anne Applebaum discuss with Fareed. Then, how far we've come and how far have we yet to go in the Covid-19 pandemic. Former CDC Director Tom Frieden tells Fareed how to thwart a fourth wave and what the new normal will look like. Finally, from the massive hack attack against US government and corporate computers that was revealed in December to this week’s revelation of a near-miss in Florida when somebody tried to raise the chemical level in a town’s water supply to poisonous levels, what is going on? New York Times cybersecurity reporter Nicole Perlroth tells Fareed why America is so vulnerable.

      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/december-13-2020-on-gps-the-great-american-vaccina</link>
      <description>Airdate December 13, 2020: The light at the end of the Covid tunnel - the first vaccines were administered in the U.K., and in the U.S. they're making their way around the country. Founder and Chairman of Moderna, Noubar Afeyan, talks to Fareed about his revolutionary vaccines and how they got from concept to ready-for-authorization so quickly. And, Britain has 18 days to reach a Brexit agreement. Can the U.K. and the E.U. find common ground? Fareed asks British journalist Zanny Minton Beddoes and Christine Ockrent, a journalist based in France.

Then, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tells Fareed about the pressure Iran feels under U.S. sanctions. What's the future of U.S.-Iran relations? Is the nuclear deal still on the table?

      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/september-20-2020-on-gps-bob-woodward-on-justice-g</link>
      <description>Airdate September 20, 2020: Bob Woodward joins Fareed to discuss the political battle ensuing over the Supreme Court vacancy left in the wake of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death earlier this week. And, Woodward in his latest book, "Rage", based on 17 on-the-record-interviews with President Trump, explores the president's alignment with leaders like Xi, Kim, Erdogan, and Putin. Why has Trump favored these strongmen above America's long-standing allies? Fareed and Woodward discuss. Then, with new Arab nations normalizing relations with Israel, will a new kind of peace come to the Middle East? Mina Al-Oraibi, editor-in-chief of the National newspaper based in the UAE, answers these questions and more. Finally, ProPublica senior environmental reporter Abrahm Lustgarten paints a picture of an America where the walls are closing in, thanks to climate change. He brings us a frightening look at our future. 9/20/2020GUESTS: Bob Woodward, Mina Al-Oraibi, Abrahm LustgartenTV-PG

What's the secret to their success? David Rubenstein shares his insights with Fareed.

      <title>August 16, 2020 | On GPS: A new peace deal in the Middle East, lessons from Denmark’s successful school re-opening, Russia claims another Sputnik moment</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/august-16-2020-on-gps-a-new-peace-deal-in-the-midd</link>
      <description>Airdate August 16 2020: The UAE becomes the 3rd Arab nation to normalize relations with Israel, Lebanon teeters on the brink, Hong Kong’s crisis deepens, and protestors contest Belarus’ election results - Fareed talks to former top State Department officials Richard Haass and Anne-Marie Slaughter about all that and Joe Biden’s pick of Kamala Harris as his running mate. Then, as the U.S. struggles to get students back to class, what can it learn from Denmark - the first European country to re-open schools (way back on April 15th)? Danish Education Minister Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil offers lessons. And Russia claims another Sputnik-like victory, but the world isn’t convinced. So, the question is: who WILL win the race for a Covid-19 vaccine? Fareed looks at the front-runners.

      <title>July 26, 2020 | On GPS: Federal agents vs protestors in Portland - is this an overreach for Trump?; U.S. says Russia, China &amp; Iran all want to meddle in 2020 election</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/july-26-2020-on-gps-federal-agents-vs-protestors-i</link>
      <description>Airdate July 26 2020: Federal agents clash with protestors in Portland, Trump says he could deploy as many as 75,000 more such agents to cities across the country. Is this an abuse of power? Former Homeland Security Secretaries Jeh Johnson and Janet Napolitano explain. Then, America's top counterintelligence official says it's not just Russia eyeing the 2020 election, China and Iran are too. What's in it for them? Nina Jankowicz and Laura Rosenberger tell Fareed what to expect as the election approaches. And, which economies will emerge stronger from Covid-19? Morgan Stanley's Ruchir Sharma says one winner will emerge. Finally, Turkey's Hagia Sophia has been reconverted to a mosque. What prompted this move amid the pandemic? Cato Institute's Mustafa Akyol explains.

Then, Biden advisor and former Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken weighs in on the future of relations between the two superpowers. Also: Iran's unexplained incidents, fires and explosions--what's behind them? Or who? The RAND Corporation's Dalia Dassa Kaye helps get to the bottom of the mystery.

Pre-eminent physician Ezekiel Emanuel diagnoses the problem…then Harvard scholar Danielle Allen offers some solutions. And, China's new draconian law threatens Hong Kong's fundamental freedoms. Protest leader Nathan Law tells Fareed what will become of his movement. Then, if Trump's Middle East peace plan put the final nail in the coffin of the two-state solution, what is the alternative?

      <title>June 28, 2020 | On GPS:  Former National Security Advisor Tom Donilon on John Bolton’s memoir; Secretary General Antonio Guterres on the UN at 75 years old.</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/june-28-2020-on-gps-former-national-security-advis</link>
      <description>Airdate June 28 2020: John Bolton's book reveals what he did, as Trump's national security advisor. But what should he have done? How should he have responded to Pres. Trump's actions? Obama National Security Advisor Tom Donilon tells Fareed what could have gone differently. Then, the UN celebrates it 75th anniversary. Is it still a force for global cooperation? Can it unite today's multipolar world? Secretary General Antonio Guterres answers these questions and more. And, Trump is trailing in the polls. Fareed talks to New York Times pollster Nate Cohn for the story behind the numbers. Finally, the U.S. once feared circumstances as dire as Italy's amid the Covid-19 crisis. America's new cases are now growing faster than Italy's did at its peak. What changed? Holly Jarman from the University of Michigan's School of Public Health explains.

      <title>June 21, 2020 | On GPS: Bolton's Bombshells &amp; revelations on Ukraine; Israel's upcoming annexation decision; Malcolm Gladwell on race &amp; policing in America</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/june-21-2020-on-gps-boltons-bombshells-revelations</link>
      <description>Airdate June 21 2020: Fareed gives his Take on John Bolton's new tell all book on the inner workings of the Trump administration. In all the books revelations Fareed says one thing is made clear: "that the real problem with Donald Trump is not his ignorance or his policies, but his character." Bolton paints yet another picture of the Ukraine scandal. In a rare commentary on such issues former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko weighs in on U.S.-Ukraine relations. Then, to annex or not to annex? Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu is eyeing territories in the West Bank. Why now? Netanyahu's predecessor Ehud Olmert explains. And, a new series on GPS - best practices for beating Covid-19. New York Times China correspondent Vivian Wang tells Fareed what we can learn from Wuhan, and how the former epicenter for the pandemic transformed to be a potential model for how to beat it. Finally, Malcolm Gladwell on race and policing in America.

      <title>June 14, 2020 | America's grim exceptionalism in policing; a Covid-success story from Europe</title>
      <link>https://omny.fm/shows/fareed-zakaria-gps/june-14-2020-americas-grim-exceptionalism-in-polic</link>
      <description>While Italy and Spain hover near 250,000 Covid cases, Greece has only had 3,000. What did it do right? Fareed talks to the Greek Prime Minister. Then, America’s grim exceptionalism - in policing. Rates of fatal shootings by American police are almost 70x those in the UK and more than 20x those in Germany. What makes American policing different? Also, is American policing systemically racist? Fareed explores the question with a professor whose work is studying such issues. Finally, the view from abroad: America's adversaries are celebrating its unrest. What will become of U.S. soft power? Guardian columnist Natalie Nougayrède and FutureMap founder Parag Khanna discuss. 

GUESTS: Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Rosa Brooks, Paul Hirschfield, Phillip Atiba Goff, Natalie Nougayrède, Parag Khanna.

And as Down Under is devastated, former Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd talks to Fareed about the role conservative politics and media in his country may have played.

      <link>http://podcast.cnn.com/episode/fareed-zakaria-gps/all/r1mqkp/gps-2019-12-22.html</link>
      <description>Airdate December 22 2019: On Wednesday, President Trump became the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. How does his impeachment compare to those of Clinton and Johnson (and the almost-impeachment of Nixon)? Fareed is joined by an all-star panel of presidential historians to discuss. Then, a rare bit of good news to round out your holiday season: global poverty (and especially extreme poverty) has shrunk considerably over the past few decades.  That's thanks to the work of people like Ester Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee - a husband and wife team who just won the Nobel Prize for their work.  Could the world actually eliminate extreme poverty?

Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke on why nations need to come together...now. Then, in an exclusive interview, Fareed speaks with Greece's newly-elected Prime Minister about how he beat his nation's populist incumbents.

      <title>Encore: Power of Putin - CNN Special Report: The Most Powerful Man in the World</title>
      <link>http://podcast.cnn.com/episode/fareed-zakaria-gps/all/np8kgg/gps-2018-09-02.html</link>
      <description>In my latest documentary, we describe Russian President Vladimir Putin as the most powerful man in the world. But why? After all, the United States -- and China, for that matter -- are more powerful countries than Russia.

The power of a head of state is determined both by the country's strength and the capacity he or she has to exercise that power, unilaterally, unconstrained by other institutions, parties and political forces. And combining those two metrics, it's easy to see why Vladimir Putin rises to the top of list.

Putin has created what he calls a "vertical of power," something unlike any we see in other great nations. As the Russian chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov -- himself a harsh critic of Putin -- has noted, the entire structure of Russian political power rests on one man. When the czar died, you knew the structure that would endure and the process by which his successor, his son, would be elevated. When the general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party died, the Standing Committee and the Politburo would select his successor. But when Putin dies -- I almost wrote if -- what will happen? No one knows.

To understand Putin, you have to understand Russia. The last hundred years for that country have seen the fall of the monarchy, the collapse of democracy, the great depression, World War II with its tens of millions of Russians dead, Stalin's totalitarian brutalities, the collapse of communism, the breakup of the Soviet Union, and Boris Yeltsin's years of chaos and corruption.

Then comes Vladimir Putin, who ushers in stability and, in popular perception, rising standards of living and increasing prominence and respect in the world. That respect is important.

Russians have immense national pride. Russia is the largest country on the planet -- 48 times larger than Germany and encompassing 11 time zones that straddle Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

Russia is also a rich country, containing some of the largest deposits of raw materials, from oil and natural gas to nickel and aluminum. Culturally, it has often thought of itself as the third Rome, preserving Christianity even as Rome and Byzantium fell to the Barbarians.To learn more about how CNN protects listener privacy, visit cnn.com/privacy
