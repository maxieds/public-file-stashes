*Yes, they definitely did, this time!* 
Mandatory transitions to a Trump Card, which requires a successful approval 
process beyond that of a traditional state license to drive motor vehicles, to exercise your right to fly, 
or drive, and eventually to participate in the America electorate (timely topic). 
The issue of a RealID endorsed identification for airline travel was mandated for the same day that I was able to 
leave confinement for a local hotel after getting trapped in Bogota, COLombia from 2022-2023. 
Florida has been an early planned (for years) adopter of the requirement to travel on airlines to destinations 
initiated through their international airports. 
This was an obvious gesture made towards me (apparently for living) which nearly prevented me from 
returning home safely to the contiguous United States on a technicality. Earlier this year, the rollout of 
mandatory adoption of RealID government forms of identification to replace the old driver's licenses was 
stated as delayed until 2025 for more discussion and consideration (after the circus and all out 
antics we all expect in the upcoming 2024 election have passed sensibly). 

RealID cards and approved driver's licenses are an option in Illinois state in 2023. 
The biometric algorithm I observed used to gain access to the IRS website to check on the status of 
long delayed tax return checks in 2022 is the same as that featured in the GoogleLENS application on 
some Android phones. A few concerned darkweb sourced news reports mention that civil suits setting 
precendents for severe civil penalties leveled towards Google and Facebook for using street light 
camera data sources to train their image-based AI profiling projects in the state of Illinois. 
This is good if we do it more liberally as soon as the issue comes up. Using a proprietary biometric 
authentication algorithm (the just-like-daddy attitude of Eric Trump, anyone?) to regulate and 
profile civilians is *ALWAYS A VERY BAD THING* to let happen!
