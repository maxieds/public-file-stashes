 <title>805: The Florida Experiment</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/805/the-florida-experiment</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Governor Ron DeSantis is running for president on the argument that he&#039;ll do for America what he&#039;s done for Florida. So what&#039;s it like in Florida?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prologue: Florida is now the fastest growing state, and DeSantis says people are moving there from all over because of him. We speak to people who did make the move, at least in part, for DeSantis’s policies. (6  minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: Among the big items in DeSantis&#039;s run for president is medical freedom. Producer Zoe Chace wanted to understand its appeal and its growing popularity. So she spent some time in Sarasota County, where one man — at the side of former Trump appointee Mike Flynn — is creating a sort of little parallel universe for this very thing. (33 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: DeSantis has passed law after law about what can and can’t be taught in Florida classrooms, starting as early as elementary school. And last spring, Florida Republicans introduced a bill initially proposing to ban things like critical race theory and identity politics, or students majoring in things like gender studies in Florida universities. Reporter Emmanuel Dzotsi followed how things unfolded at one of the biggest universities there, Florida State, from the bill’s introduction all the way to its passage. He explains how professors and students have been preparing. (25 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Three: Among the legislation introduced by DeSantis that has passed is a ban on minors receiving transition care. The bill passed into law a few months ago. We speak with a teen whose family has since had to flee the state in order to access the care they needed. (2 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/805/transcript&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>804: The Retrievals</title>
 <link>https://www.thisamericanlife.org/804/the-retrievals</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At a Yale fertility clinic, dozens of women began their I.V.F. cycles full of expectation and hope. Then a surgical procedure caused them excruciating pain. In the hours that followed, some of the women called the clinic to report their pain — but most of the staff members who fielded the patients’ reports did not know the real reason for the pain, which was that a nurse at the clinic was stealing fentanyl and replacing it with saline. What happened at that clinic? What are the stories we tell about women&#039;s pain and what happens when we minimize or dismiss it?

The Retrievals, a new five-part series from Serial Productions, is hosted and reported by longtime This American Life producer and editor Susan Burton. We&#039;re excited to bring you the first episode today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prologue: Ira Glass introduces the first episode of a new podcast from longtime This American Life producer and editor Susan Burton. (1 minute)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act One: Susan Burton introduces some of the many women who went to a Yale fertility clinic for IVF treatment, and charts their experience from hopeful beginning to excruciatingly painful egg retrieval. (27 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act Two: Often bypassing logic, the women go to great lengths to construct elaborate stories to make sense of their inexplicable pain. And then, a letter arrives. (25 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/804/transcript&quot;&gt;thisamericanlife.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
