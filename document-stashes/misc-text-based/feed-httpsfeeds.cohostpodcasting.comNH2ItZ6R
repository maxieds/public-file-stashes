  <description><![CDATA[<p>You know what they say about assumptions? In short, they are bad. The danger in making assumptions is that they set us up for disappointment. They can easily evolve into expectations and lead us to make decisions based on information we assume is still valid. The truth is change is inevitable, which makes assumptions counterproductive.

If we were able to really live a life that questions more and is more curious, rather than assuming, the benefit of that would be, not just that we’d be wiser and know more, but more importantly we’d have less pain and more joy.” </p><p>– Michael Berg</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>None of us are perfect, yet most of us try to project a perfect image of ourselves to the world. Though we’ve been taught that being vulnerable is akin to showing weakness, the truth is that it displays our inner strength and is a key aspect of living an authentic, fulfilling life. For when we express vulnerability, we show we’re honest with ourselves and accept who we truly are – flaws and all. We diminish our ego and push past its attempts to block our Light. And we strengthen our relationships with the people closest to us. Tune in as Monica and Michael explore the myriad blessings that come with embracing and showing our vulnerability.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>“Being vulnerable allows us to get the most out of life and out of each life experience.” – Monica Berg</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>Daring Greatly</em>, by Brené Brown</p><p><em>Atlas of the Heart</em>, by Brené Brown</p>]]></description>
