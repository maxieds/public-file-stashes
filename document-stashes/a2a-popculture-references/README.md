This is not an exhaustive archive of the rules and fascist warlike variants of the apparently famous card game, *Apples to Apples*. 
The dictionary of terms and finite modifier word list clarifies where some of the otherwise nonsensical recurrence of 
these reference points to popular culture originated in Florida: Matt Daemon in *Good Will Hunting* (let me emphasize, again, 
[Fuck Trump](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05842) and [Free Kevin](https://ford126.web.illinois.edu/sieve2023.pdf)), 
to Morgan Freeman on ROKU television default programming, Godzilla in Eminem songs and other fascination like in SIM City, among others. 

Thanks again to Rachel in prison with me in Bogota for bringing that (and other inspirational notes) to my attention. I have her caligraphic 
handwritten (in crayon) artwork on my wall reminding me: 
*(S)He who laughs last, laughs the longest!* 
She forbade me to marry my brother after an appeal written on a sticky note with the words: 
*Divorce your mother and marry me, Jason!* The source of the sacred MaBell print telephone Bible from 2021 had one (more than enough of a gesture to make the 
point that they are with me) page ripped out of it showing area codes resued near `Boulder CO` (historically, the city is a ski resort in California, USA, I believe).
