# List of projects related to the archived data

Let's get to one key point about my taking the time to write all this out and post 
previews of archived documents that pertain to civil actions over much of what my family 
and myself have been put through over the last decade or more. 
I am very outspoken about because it's the right thing to do. 
Time will tell whether longterm progress is worth short-term political convenience for the current election cycle. 
People who are prone to overreaction to discussions like these freely on the public Internet tend to fall into 
one of two classes: those who are sensitive to language or the events that are inferred from the discussion; or, 
those who endorse these misdeeds and anti-social violence with malintent to prevent the disemination of these details 
and block others from engaging in discourse about malicious technological activities that
too often go under the radar.  

## Archive and enumerate new AR/VR

The Facebook parent company, META (eerily like early TransMETA Linux kernel support from NL), has a primary 
research area af AR/VR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality). This is most certainly NOT an innocent technology. 
While unintentionally on a darkweb network connection where search engines index the darkweb (as opposed to access in the 
USA proper for most which is likened to walking aroun turning over stones to find things you do not know how to locate 
explicitly -- cf. You never really know where you are on/in Facebook, and the platform's ability to *delete* --deep-- links 
along with user profiles). I viewed three to four big software company API/SDK binary bundles available for download there. 
These need to be archived for public review. The task includes enumerating phone interfaces and car navigation interfaces 
(including SXM and --amateur-- radio references in those safari locations). 

### Timely side discussions

A message about the recent VR topics getting so much news recently worth repeating again: 
*Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.*

Someone pointed out to me in Florida earlier this year (2023) that Kush (my beloved cat thing) thinks I'm a superhero. 
In the sense of me being the hero, or avatar, or lead action figure in a video game, and AI being something that is programmed into the 
game by developers to automatically sense and fight (profile, target; you all get it) me as the primary character it focuses on disabling, what 
other scary or ominous warnings out we heed about the roll out of this nasty gaming construct on Earth? 

## Working topics short list - Full details to be completed later

* Darkweb-like geolocation of nodes + square-thingy-type BT/BLE meshes and location-relative QR barcodes on the recent Android Go phones. 
* Google Earth views on the darkweb connection - scary.
* Caches of variants of darkweb sourced static map data. This includes two+ variants of Google Maps (web searchable with Tesla/car, EV stations and
  other odd nearby location markers listed on the default site) -- one is GPS-like floating point oordinate pair based and another observed involves
  a reference point (like highway I-25) and an alphanumerica 6–8 digit location identifier (probably some local lookup table caches).
  Another is a unique way of refering to hard-to-find physical addresses in a format that can be used for Amazon Prime deliveries.
  Other sources of this type of data include: a map set to use in the Ukraine (need to recall naming conventions), standard GPS device or OpenLocation
  map variants, searchable website based map data (mapinfo named site?) based out of a start point
  (like 'country' source, or moving around the SXM navigation lookups with only 8–12
  fixed big cities like Los Angeles [as shown within this video](https://youtu.be/kauCzrwGk6A?si=JK76No44yj9IQhZM) and
  strange relative Washington DC directions and clearly marked state/site Owners to tag whom
  people are bound in the territory and options to print directions to Russia useful since telling safari participants you are Russian and of a red
  Bolshevik temperament scares the Hell out of them and makes them not want to mess with you, and localized WyoRoadInfo site data (nearby the 'Rawlins WY' into
  Yellowstone National Park / NASCAR hangout entrance).
  <br/>
  In response to one of Donald Trump's sons who asked whether or not it was possible to get back to the North (South) Pole in front of Sean Penn
  (who introduced himself to me earlier while I was writing out details notes in the corner with: *Oh, so you know how to read?*):
  <br/>
  *Yes, indeed you can get back. The directions are relative to the coordinate system of whichever version of Google Maps you ar using. There are instructions to
  find this building someone stuck to the building map on the wall*. Referenced by: `I-25 + C470E` near 'Denver CO' -- note the no-comma naming convention.
* Archive copies of (Windows/EXE or Java/jar based binary distributions) RNA software that is available and fairly up-to-date as of the last few years. These include the programs compared in [this listing](https://github.com/gtDMMB/RNAStructViz/wiki/SoftwareComparisions).
Some other easy-to-find RNA secondary structure editing and manipulation programs and copies of current libraries like ViennaRNA or RNAstructure are often removed from the web after new versions are published
([see one workaround of this type here](https://github.com/gtDMMB/homebrew-core/tree/master/LocalPatches)).
The late night pandemic video chat sessions over scotch and Python scripting discussions that led to remarks about how
these programs facilitate 'playing God' with biology is an important artifact of the time we need to preserve this way.
Many years from now, people should be able to throwback to the forgotten era of this decade and play God with the universe like
it's 2020 in America. I assume that any people that do not like the idea based not on what we say, but the way we say it, 
do not understand what this means clearly enough yet.

### Notes about things to remember or that bother me about the recent technology

* As of this week (in mid October of 2023), Google Play Developer Console is assigning developers of apps homework (like they are children, or kids) to add details that are easily scanned with automated scripts on their end. They also require that all new updates to existing apps target the latest Android SDK -- in effect, forcing an update that is scary in light of my Android Go phone and the AI discussions. One new link they are suggesting is for **deep** (app) links, another imprecisely defined average use case that people need to be aware is going on (cf. App Clips on iOS / ipad as of 2023). See also below.

* I have seen a version of [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/MCk82FwReR4?si=xjQ67evyeiQJKald) (user: Paul Simmons) on someone else's phone with `Remix` functionality and audio that is much different in the last several months. The audio can be sped up and filtere to obtain audio tracks similar to the original (transistor technology, anyone?). I wonder if those versions of this video could be processed with Matlab to see what else is going on chirp-wise outside of the usual human audible spectrum. These new phones and LED/LCD light strips really pissed off my cat who could hear the demons and what they were saying. This is not unlike old SourceForge projects that used CRT monitors (now very much higher power LCD screens) to use bar patterns to produce MP3 quality audio that could be tuned with a frequency scanner they used to sell at RadioShack. There are also some weird things going on with YouTube videos (like the Notorious B.I.G.'s *Sky is the limit* with album cover artwork) with lightening flashes in the background that seem to signify this type of audio source. I think there are TikTok (as in the TikTok *kids*, or adult children of the devil) connectors to the applications that generate this noise. What about variants of what I would assume should be a standard 3.5mm audio headphone jack connector that can be connected in cars with [SXM type navigation firmware](https://youtu.be/kauCzrwGk6A?si=JK76No44yj9IQhZM) (N.b., [my Android Go phone](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/tree/main/androidgo-default-install) can tune FM radio and do a lot of GSM dancing to/from different operator sources abroad -- see [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@maxieschmidt) for community posts and playlists with some evidence)?

#### Updates to the two entries above

1. The Biggie song is called *Going Back to Cali*. The video link on the darkweb tethered ipad I am referencing is [linked here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TiBKJICijL4) (video unavailable on sane connections sourced here in Chicago, Illinois, USA, North America, Earth; a link to a similar listing is [apparently here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TiBKJlCijL4) which appears the same but will load after a search engine proxy to the link).
2. The Paul Simmons video mentioned above that I saw this year on someone else's phone had something like 635 VIEWS at the time. Note that this is now given as the approximate number of FOLLOWERS of his channel on YouTube. What can we reasonably infer from this? Probably that the followers of his feeds are the ones responsible for the auditory assault that my cat could hear. Oh, Kushy Bear, Mama's going to kill some trolls! 
3. A link to an imperfect, but topical video taken on the tablet earlier today is available [on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXKOwefI10s). A couple of others are recently uploaded. One documents some strange behavior of Google Drive when the operator noticed that it was doing something it (it) doesn't like. A first GitHub repository to attract software companies based on solutions to daily problems on LeetCode in JavaScript was witnessed over COVID, and it turns out, not just for novel showcase.
4. The insanity of this situation is that I have a small group of paranoid, panicky meth freaks charged with dictating whether or not operations on my devices are approved or not (this way since Casper WY late last year). The stall period made me want to share the ipad connection which is obviously tethered to darkweb (VPN) sources under the hood (Jamf/MDM WIFI boot installer from Walmart that I cannot fix). How can this task be accomplished to give others access to the Apple App Store I have been stuck with using a standard proxy configuration? How are Apple App Clips (deep app links elsewhere) spawned? On Android (since NFC Beam became a feature), default handling of strange link forms (like the unexplained UUID Java types on Android) are hidden and not accurately documented -- there is a text interface with accessibility settings to paste command shortcuts, correct?

### Barcodes and operation disguised to end users (operation dismantle square thingies)

The common QR (bar)codes and similar identifiers to access information linked online is everywhere. 
I started collecting examples and variants of these codes in August of 2022 relocating to Albuqueque 
where unusual new conventions and their easy to spot (hard to block) use cases were everywhere 
as tacky satanic graffiti. Small square codes with very little data make sense in medical applications 
like emergency rooms where the unique ID associated with the encoding has high turn over 
(small number of collisions). Some of these variants encode inactive (organic) chemical compounds in 
everyday items like deoderant that can be activated (light or sound frequency; cf. the 
[16S or 5S RNA structure types](https://github.com/gtDMMB/RNAStructViz) 
with no overlapping compound components that can collide in this process -- ever so interesting as is the 
project of scraping / data mining biology databases like those funded by the NIH for details about organic 
compounds, not organisms, that are in active research deployment). Some are different ways of expressing 
tunable audio frequencies (AC/AAC/ADC/DC, etc.) in nearby areas. Others are annoying variants of the usual 
that are only hard to interpret if you are not provided the scheme in use. 
Here are some topical observations about the technology: 
* I have questioned the construct of QR barcodes with very little, only large block granular data points, collecting examples. If the corresponding URL forms are shortened, then where is the local (locally distributed) cache stored to resolve these references when such codes are generated on-the-fly? The term QR refers to a (**0-1**) matrix factorization, correct? Part of the resolution of pointers from these encodings are location based whereby an indeterminate component in decoding is filled in by context sensitive locality (whatever that entails, not just GPS on the map). This observation makes me nervous at a medical office with posters advertising that COVID or HIV test results for patients are accessible by scanning a QR barcode on the wall with their mobile device.
* What about the LCD/LED screens that can generate frequency (sound or light) data, or the BT/BLE/LED enabled light strip tape around many device ports on my cell phones being used to inform nearby entities about context for locally unique lookups? Is this why Chrome indicates to come close to the screen to read a new QR code it has generated on my behalf? These devices communicate so much more information than meets the human eyes and ears -- and, I have noticed, things with respect to that hidden fiasco are filthier than ever. What about using the front/back camera sources with facial recognition (profiling) software that is integrated on the platform to inform these exchanges (see the [folder of archived documents](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/tree/main/document-stashes/google_lens-irs_trumpcard_to_fly-realid) about the RealID debates and the Google LENS algorithm underneath the 2022 IRS tax return registration). 
* Mention of Lithium ION batteries with +/- (okay, not unusual) and an auxiliary data port (edges and signal). These compact enclosures remind me of small SSD drives. The example on my phone will retain (transmit) its charge with the middle data port covered by RF shielding (thick layers of tin foil), but there will be no status communicated to the device about battery life/TTL or drain usage statistics.

### More points about recent technology underpinnings

A device hardware and software summary document saved from a factory reset of Android Go 1-2 months ago (early fall of 2023) is 
now [available here](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/blob/main/document-stashes/Device%20Info.pdf). It's listings reflect some bothersome subtle functionality and access points that this section was created to collect some thoughts on:
* __Release date:__ September 11, 2020 (base Android 11/R OS) 
* *HeardThat* (non-user naming convention) app (com.singsoftnext.**deephearing**) v1.7.286 -- I am still not happy about the focus of tech giant companies on so-called deep learning (as on the new Android link types inspired by the black market and darkweb) as of recent!
* __Processor type:__ ARM architecture variant
* __CPU hardware:__ Unisoc variant (I assume like the reflashable FPGA ISA ROM binaries due to Intel last year that caused panic and genuine concern from their execs about the discovery of opcodes that will break out of the sandbox in any VM/emulator -- my unspeakable annoyance about simply knowing the password, in the form of suppressed documentation of technology specs, being a substitute for sophistication).
* __Processor type (multicore spec):__ Listed as a quadcore with 4x1.40GHz units should be power LOADED for this era. The phone is still sluggish and packaged with the new Android Go OS designed to make modern Droid platforms portable to older or cheaper hardware. *Is it possible that the device is really just a thin client that is using cloud VMs to run all it's blessed functionality -- that is, a noisy overnetworked screen (if only I had a brain, one repeats in the Wizard of Oz reproduced within the phone settings)?* N.b., the perverse notion of an `app' as some sort of parasitic spawn (speak of the process) that runs atop your/my (anyone really who is uniquely barcoded up to contextually local uniqueness of reference which may or may not vary with time and other parameters) stack draining resources it consumes seems newer (this year).
* __CPU governor:__ I have never heard this technical description before. As in (bitch call me) the mayor of my virtual town?

### Attempts at deconvolving the online AI madness mathematically - takeways and suggestions

#### Remarks and takeaways

Amidst mostly contentless news blurbs about Trump's upcoming trials, it seems that online, 
the man has the attitude that if he is going to jail (Hell, for the rest of his life), 
then everyone else is going down with him. All this while the USA government will surely 
shut down over a last second rule modification from ex-speaker McCarthy to let the 
party extremists, like Matt Gaetz of Florida, block progress for a long time to stall while 
Trump is processed in court. Jim Jordan was unable to secure enough votes 
(of 217 red party only required) because he will pardon Trump. Meanwhile, others throw chaos at the online universe that only some 
may see, and certainly only to deprive individuals in the opposition from being able to 
stay in sane contact (phones, email, the works). I have crazy QANON spewing people that refuse to 
leave me alone in particular - many of whom attended some high school I did not affiliate with 
almost twenty years ago.

The apparent onset of AI-based technology on the accounts I use boils down to randomized (disorganized) chaos and Nazi-ism
**[R1-R4]**. Also, roughly, where you started dictates where you are going, but you will probably not be that far where you land
from where you began (in the coarse caste system) **[R5]**. The next points list an interpretation that suggests some of the 
details to schemes.

* I like what Theo de Raadt has done with OpenBSD over the years. He provides cutting edge implementations of protocols and
  interfaces that get used in production while secretly archiving the (invertible, within reason) encoding schemes
  (up to export laws for cryptography out of Canada; kind of like Google certificates being banned and Microsoft Windows OS
  being necessarily open source in China where they remember Vietnam):
  *So long, and thanks (thx) for all the passwords (a-sholes)!*
* Note that my phone has not been updated in a while so that the SN2 (presumably encoding to transition to the next level of the
  scheme is missing; or possibly, I have been selected for termination as a loser in the previous round as one of the top 1-2 percent -
  no future, no index). 
* The square-thingy barcode associated with my node is accessed from the `ValidationTools` app, viewing the `TestInfo` output running
  the main activity. The two serial numbers could be varied with an emulator environment for Android OS
  (see [these APK binaries](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/tree/main/androidgo-default-install)).
  This can be used to extract encodings with respect to (each of the four?) an encoding of the elements of the finite
  field used by glyphs, or pix(map) icons that form a seamless wallpaper. 
* Note that recently, a fourth nation on Earth (India) is reported to have journeyed to the Moon and back.
  This seems to mark a completion of the `|S_3|=6` stages (reichs) so that we are working with `|S_4|=24`.
  This gives some clues about the encoding schemes with extra insight from some of the references and topics listed below.
  The decompositions of the Galois groups (up to isomorphism: pick direct products of `F_{q^k}` for `q` prime and `k`
  a positive integer.
* Elon Musk considers the numbers `420 = 4 * 105 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7` and `69 = 13^2` *funny* (dead, digested).
* The 105-problem introduced for a 1K/USD reward by Ronald Graham requests a proof that there are infinitely many
  natural numbers `n` such that `n` is simultateously invertible under arithmetic modulo `3,5,7`:
  `n === 1 (mod 3)`, `n === 1 (mod 5)` and `n === (mod 7)`. The proofs for a M-problem where `M` is squarefree with
  exactly `k` prime factors are essentially the same. Erdos has work on the case where `k = 2`.
* Triangulation schemes with elliptic curves (Riemannian sphere coordinate systems) require three points along the curve to
  completely define it (like Moebius transformations in complex analysis). Now that we have four reference points that are
  apparent, what coordinate system in 4-D should we assert is used?

#### Parenthetical notes: 

* **[R1]:** In any random variable with a Gaussian distribution, 95-percent of the of values of the variable lie within
  two standard deviations of the mean (also, quartiles). Normalizing so that the mean is about zero, this means that the so-called
  top 1-percent to 2-percent who lose (value is reduced by playing in the game) lie in the bottom two (Levels 1 and 2) of five
  (Levels 3, 4 and 5; with default placement in the Level 3 salary category at Google for employees with a PhD).
  Incidentally, the process of asserting that debt (or losses) by someone (alternately, gains by someone else, inversely)
  should be accrued by a geometric doubling rate is anti-Semitic (examples upon polite request).
* **[R2]:** See the economic models related to normal distributions of population yearly salaries and zero sum game models
  (random walk) in [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Applications) -
  rough timelines and academic affiliations of the credits. 
* **[R3]:** I have heard intelligent comments about Trump being likened to a modern day Robin Hood.
* **[R4]:** Fables about needing to wait 300 years for the development of a very different theory to prove the
  Riemann Hypothesis (classical version, sums over positive integer objects). This and observations like the short novelette by
  DOnald E. Knuth (favored by someone relevant to all this as generalizing the algebraic construction of integers from whole numbers,
  rationals from integers, reals from the rationals, complexes from the reals, with other interest points like the quaternions and the
  surreal numbers) titled *Surreal numbers*. 
* **[R5]:** Poset constructions with the zero sum game (3-percent) partition the participants at
  the end of a (fantasy sport) bracket (round) into those that win (gain, or do not lose value; at 3-percent) and those
  that lose (1/2-percent). The branching factor is `1/2` corresponding to `1/sqrt(2 * pi) * Int_{-inf}^{0} exp(-t^2/2) dt = 1/2`
  (with a standard normal distribution mean of zero).

  3. Determinant formulas (matrix inversions over groups) stated in terms of functions (elements of symmetric group, other variants)
  4. The poset constructions based on ascents, or ascending set sizes, 
     are related to somer topics in Romik's article 
     *Partitions of n into sqrt(n) parts* (2005). On pages 2-4 of the 
     article, the author estalishes asymptotics for minimal difference 
     partitions of size `d`. On page 4 (at the end of section 1), 
     there is a reference to new a use of 
     [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) 
     (the AI deployment over the last few weeks has let Wikipedia 
     suggest applications of this topic that are more timely and 
     relevant than usual).

* In the context of zero sum games and fantasy baseball/SXM sport bracketed tournaments: What does the use of *left behind* tend to mean? 
* Musk stated before the big purchase that he wanted to make Twitter all darkweb. What did he mean? YouTube video listings are partitioned into
