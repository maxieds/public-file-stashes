The Facebook parent company, META (eerily like early TransMETA Linux kernel support from NL), has a primary 
research area af AR/VR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality). This is most certainly NOT an innocent technology. 
While unintentionally on a darkweb network connection where search engines index the darkweb (as opposed to access in the 
USA proper for most which is likened to walking aroun turning over stones to find things you do not know how to locate 
explicitly -- cf. You never really know where you are on/in Facebook, and the platform's ability to *delete* --deep-- links 
along with user profiles). I viewed three to four big software company API/SDK binary bundles available for download there. 
These need to be archived for public review. The task includes enumerating phone interfaces and car navigation interfaces 
(including SXM and --amateur-- radio references in those safari locations). 

## Working topics short list -- full details to add later

* Darkweb-like geolocation of nodes + square-thingy-type BT/BLE meshes and location-relative QR barcodes on the recent Android Go phones. 
* Google Earth views on the darkweb connection - scary.
* Caches of variants of darkweb sourced static map data. This includes two+ variants of Google Maps (web searchable with Tesla/car, EV stations and
  other odd nearby location markers listed on the default site) -- one is GPS-like floating point oordinate pair based and another observed involves
  a reference point (like highway I-25) and an alphanumerica 6--8 digit location identifier (probably some local lookup table caches).
  Another is a unique way of refering to hard-to-find physical addresses in a format that can be used for Amazon Prime deliveries.
  Other sources of this type of data include: a map set to use in the Ukraine (need to recall naming conventions), standard GPS device or OpenLocation
  map variants, searchable website based map data (mapinfo named site?) based out of a start point
  (like 'country' source, or moving around the SXM navigation lookups with only 8--12
  fixed big cities like Los Angeles [as shown within this video](https://youtu.be/kauCzrwGk6A?si=JK76No44yj9IQhZM) and
  strange relative Washington DC directions and clearly marked state/site Owners to tag whom
  people are bound in the territory and options to print directions to Russia useful since telling safari participants you are Russian and of a red
  Bolshevik temperament scares the Hell out of them and makes them not want to mess with you, and localized WyoRoadInfo site data (nearby the 'Rawlins WY' into
  Yellowstone National Park / NASCAR hangout entrance).

  In response to one of Donald Trump's sons who asked whether or not it was possible to get back to the North (South) Pole in front of Sean Penn
  (who introduced himself to me earlier while I was writing out details notes in the corner with: *Oh, so you know how to read?*):
  <br/>
  *Yes, indeed you can get back. The directions are relative to the coordinate system of whichever version of Google Maps you ar using. There are instructions to
  find this building someone stuck to the building map on the wall*. Referenced by: `I-25 + C470E` near 'Denver CO' -- note the no-comma naming convention.
