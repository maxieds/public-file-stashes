This escaled considerably from [11/12/2023 to 11/14/2023 - see videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmmm4oraikM&list=PLKuEX1pHu60ora2BpfYO6qsQENGbe02MC&pp=iAQB). 
My [recent (partial) metadata postings](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/tree/chimerax-datamine-apkzips/androidgo) of the `chimerax` data on my 
[badly mauled AndroidGo phone](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/tree/markdown-drafts/_project) were where I backtracked and started again on after 
11/14/2023 ([see videos about *How to get away from Trump? AnthonyX (NYC mafia) nearly killed me this month - Video NN*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmmm4oraikM&list=PLKuEX1pHu60ora2BpfYO6qsQENGbe02MC&pp=iAQB)). 
I saw Jeff Lagarias outside the Chicago Public Library location driving by angrily in a loud pickup truck that morning. 
I wonder if [this strange non-responsive burst](https://github.com/gtDMMB/pmfe2023/issues/5) reflects the attitude about me publicly discussing GPU/chimera applications being 
more about physics and [scary AI-WEB realities](https://github.com/maxieds/public-file-stashes/blob/main/PROJECTS.md) than computer graphics at UC Berkeley?
