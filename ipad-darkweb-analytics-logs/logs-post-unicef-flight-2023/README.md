These are the hidden analytics logs on the darkweb sourced ipad tablet collected after 
leavig Florida from 04/2023 onwards. They contain a number of identifiers of 
those who abused my system. These include UUID fields that may have some sort of reverse 
lookup that is still around with MineCraft servers or TorBrowserOnion mining by turning 
over rocks and stones (unless one has the Zelda master keys; 
hint: Change the password on Oogie Boogie Man this time -- X Imbetifet XYOul, Ohhh, ohhh!).
